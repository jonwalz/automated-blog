Central Time inside the Cotton Bowl and the Golden Hat Trophy was on the head of Texas football head coach Steve Sarkisian as his top-ranked Longhorns were celebrating their 34-3 thumping of the No.18/16-ranked Oklahoma Sooners on Saturday afternoon. \n\nIt took six games into the 2024 season for an opponent to take the lead against Texas (6-0, 2-0), but the Longhorns quickly overcame Oklahoma's 42-yard field goal on the Sooners' (4-2, 1-2) third offensive drive of the game, a drive that took 4:42 off the clock and saw OU move the ball just 38 yards on 11 plays. The drive, which began with 4:52 left in the first quarter and ended with 10 seconds left, was the only one on the day for the team up north that did not end in either a punt, turnover or end of half. \n\nAfter receiving the ensuing kickoff minutes later, quarterback Quinn Ewers, in his first action for Texas since UT's 56-7 win over UTSA on Saturday, Sept. 14, orchestrated a 10-play, 75-yard drive that resulted in a 7-yard touchdown reception from redshirt-junior signal caller to tight end Gunnar Helm three minutes and 50 seconds later. The drive was the first of six different scoring opportunities — on 12 offensive possessions — for the Longhorn offense that rolled up 406 total yards of offense on 61 plays against a Sooner defense that ranked 43rd in the country in total defense. \n\nOver the course of the final five minutes of the second quarter, Texas capped its 21-unanswered points during the second quarter with back-to-back touchdowns as Silas Bolden fell on a loose football in the end zone following a 36-yard run by Quintrevion Wisner. Wisner, again, torched the Sooner defense for another lengthy run during the Longhorns' next offensive series as the sophomore running back out of Glenn Heights, Texas, trotted into the end zone from 43 yards out for a 1-play touchdown drive following the first of two Oklahoma lost fumbles on consecutive drives. \n\nEven though Ewers and wide receiver Ryan Wingo were unable to connect on a 4th-and-2 play at the Oklahoma 10-yard line during Texas' first possession in the third quarter, Bert Auburn added to the Longhorns' 21-3 halftime lead the next time the offense took the field as the senior place kicker connected from 41 yards out. The Flower Mound, Texas, native went on to make a 29-yarder with 7:44 remaining in the game to push UT's lead out to 27-3. \n\nAfter the Texas defense stopped the Oklahoma offense, which totaled 168 yards of total offense prior its 17-play, 5:21 drive to end the game, on fourth down at its own 32-yard line with 6:21 left in the contest, Helm out-jumped two members of the Sooner secondary on a pass thrown by wide receiver Matthew Golden from 30 yards away. The Longhorn tight end fell to the ground at the 2-yard line to setup a 1-yard rush by Jerrick Gibson that proceeded a 1-yard touchdown run by Ewers. \n\nThe rushing touchdown by the Southlake, Texas, native concluded a second half that saw the Texas offense score on its final three possessions of the game and six of its last nine dating back to the Ewers-to-Helm passing touchdown early in the second quarter.  \n\nUP NEXT\n\nWith ESPN's College GameDay set to come to Austin, Texas next Saturday, the top-ranked Texas Longhorns will host the No. 5/4 Georgia Bulldogs (4-1, 2-1) at 6:30 p.m. CT in a matchup presented by Truist. \n\nFOLLOW US\n\nFor the latest information on the team, follow @TexasFootball on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

They failed to score the remainder of the game after converting a field goal on their second possession. Texas’ offense was the exact opposite, gaining 406 total yards against Oklahoma’s stout defense.\n\nQuarterback Quinn Ewers was efficient in his return from injury after missing parts of the past three games, completing 20 of 29 passes for 199 yards with a touchdown to an interception, also rushing for a 1-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter.  The Longhorns’ rushing attack was a nice surprise, as the group ran for 177 yards and three touchdowns on 30 carries as a team on Saturday.\n\nTexas certainly looked like the No. 1-ranked team in the country on Saturday, with Oklahoma hoping to desperately find some offense the rest of the season.\n\nHere’s the updates and highlights from Texas’ big 34-3 win over Oklahoma on Saturday:\n\nTexas vs Oklahoma score\n\nThis section will be updated.\n\nTEAMS\t1Q\t2Q\t3Q\t4Q\tF\nOklahoma\t3\t0\t0\t0\t3\nTexas\t0\t21\t3\t10\t34\nTexas vs Oklahoma updates\nTexas wins it 34-3\n\nOklahoma had a goal-line chance late in the fourth quarter to try for its first touchdown of the game but couldn't convert as the clock ran out. Texas wins the 2024 Red River Rivalry 34-3 in dominant fashion.\n\nTexas piling it on\n\nLonghorns pull off a trick play double pass the play after forcing a turnover, which sets up a 1-yard touchdown run by Ewers. Texas leads 34-3 late in the fourth quarter.\n\nReceiver Matthew Golden caught a pass behind the line of scrimmage and fired a pass downfield for tight end Gunnar Helm, who climbed the ladder over Oklahoma safety Robert Spears-Jennings.\n\nOklahoma turns it over on downs\n\nSooners don't have much choice but to go for it on fourth down with a 27-3 deficit, but Hawkins Jr. throws it away on fourth-and-3 and turns it over on downs.\n\nTexas makes 27-yard field goal\n\nLonghorns extend lead to 27-3 on the 27-yard field goal by Bert Auburn. Oklahoma regains possession with over 7:30 left in the fourth quarter.\n\nTexas returns Oklahoma punt 61 yards\n\nTexas' Silas Bolden with a big play, returning Oklahoma's punt 61 yards to the Sooners' 18-yard line. Texas is in full control.\n\nTexas hits 41-yard field goal\n\nLonghorns aren't able to get back in the end zone but have burned a lot of clock offensively in the third quarter. Texas caps off its 11-play, 45-yard drive with a field goal by Bert Auburn to take a 24-3 lead. Texas held the ball for 5:35 of game clock there.\n\nTexas turns it over on downs\n\nTexas turns it over on downs after attempting a fourth-and-2 try from Oklahoma's 10-yard line. Sooners with a nice goal-line stand, but will need to make some plays offensively here backed up in their own territory.\n\nOklahoma punts again\n\nSooners just can't get anything going offensively. Their 18-point deficit feels like much more given their inability to move the ball so far.\n\nTexas misses field goal before halftime\n\nTexas attempted a 44-yard field goal with seven seconds before halftime, and Bert Auburn missed it.\n\nAuburn got two chances, as he missed the first attempt, but Oklahoma coach Brent Venables called a timeout just before the kick. Auburn then missed it again.\n\nThings going sideways for Oklahoma\n\nTwo plays, two fumbles for the Sooners. Oklahoma's first play after allowing the touchdown is another fumble, as freshman Taylor Tatum has the ball punched out after gaining a first down.\n\nLonghorns regain possession and things are turning disastrous for Oklahoma.\n\nTexas takes 21-3 lead\n\nLonghorns take 21-3 lead on a 35-yard touchdown run by Tre Wisner. Texas needed just one play after forcing a turnover to go up 18 points with 1:40 until halftime.\n\nTexas forces fumble\n\nHawkins Jr. takes a designed run, but is tackled from behind by Anthony Hill and fumbles.\n\nLonghorns get the ball back on Oklahoma's 35-yard line.\n\nTexas takes 14-3 lead\n\nLonghorns with a pair of long plays, as Ewers hits Ryan Wingo for a 44-yard gain before Wisner runs 20 yards for a touchdown.

Ewers hit Gunnar Helm on a tight end screen for a 7-yard touchdown to take a 7-3 lead.\n\nHelm also made a 21-yard catch on the drive after evading an Oklahoma tackler and breaking free for a solid gain. Ewers was 6 of 7 for 65 yards and a touchdown that series after going three-and-out on Texas' first three possessions.\n\nOklahoma takes 3-0 lead\n\nSooners take a 3-0 lead on a 42-yard field goal by Tyler Keltner.

The Sooners have a terrific defense but won’t be able to keep up with the Longhorns. Quinn Ewers comes back and shakes off some early rust to keep the SEC title train on the tracks.\n\nThomas Jones: Texas 38, Oklahoma 13. Barring a flurry of turnovers, the Longhorns should cruise against a Sooner squad struggling to find its offensive identity.\n\nDavid Eckert: Texas 28, Oklahoma 14. Texas will win this game comfortably if it wins the turnover battle. With Quinn Ewers likely back under center and a freshman in Michael Hawkins Jr. quarterbacking the Sooners, that feels likely.\n\nThe Oklahoman:\n\nRyan Aber: Texas 24, Oklahoma 20. OU’s defense stands strong, but Arch Manning comes off the bench to throw for a touchdown late to lift the top-ranked Longhorns to victory. The Sooners’ offense shows some life under Michael Hawkins Jr., but it isn’t quite enough as the Longhorns hold on.\n\nJenni Carlson: Texas 27, Oklahoma 10. Texas' size and strength on the lines of scrimmage is too much for OU. Michael Hawkins settles in, plays fairly clean, gives Sooners offensive hope moving forward.\n\nJoe Mussatto: Texas 38, OU 13. OU’s offense sputters again, this time with no one to turn to. Quinn Ewers and the ‘Horns reveal cracks in Sooner defense.\n\nTexas vs Oklahoma betting odds\n\nOdds courtesy of BetMGM as of Saturday, Oct. 12\n\nSpread: Texas (-16.5)\nOver/under: 49\nMoneyline: Texas -900 | Oklahoma +575\nTexas vs Oklahoma injury updates\n\nInjuries courtesy of Friday night's SEC availability report update:\n\nTexas: RB CJ Baxter (out), RB Christian Clark (out), RB Velton Gardner (out), DB Derek Williams Jr. (probable), RB Colin Page (probable), P/K Michael Kern (probable), DS Tate Haver (probable).\nOklahoma: WR Jayden Gibson (out), WR Jalil Farooq (out), WR Nic Anderson (out), WR Deion Burks (out), WR Andrel Anthony (out), DB Gentry Williams (out), DB Kendel Dolby (out), TE Kade McIntyre (out), OL Geirean Hatchett (out).\nOklahoma football schedule 2024\n\nHere’s a look at the Sooners’ full 2024 football schedule, including dates, times and television designations:\n\nAll times Eastern.\n\nFriday, Aug. 30: vs. Temple (W, 51-3)\nSaturday, Sept. 7: vs. Houston (W, 16-12)\nSaturday, Sept. 14: vs. Tulane (W, 34-19)\nSaturday, Sept. 21: vs. Tennessee (L, 25-15)\nSaturday, Sept. 28: at Auburn* (W, 27-21)\nSaturday, Oct. 5: BYE\nSaturday, Oct. 12: vs. No. 1 Texas* (Dallas) | 3:30 p.m. | ABC (ESPN+ and Fubo)\nSaturday: Oct. 19: vs. South Carolina*\nSaturday, Oct. 26: at No. 8 Ole Miss*\nSaturday, Nov. 2: vs. Maine | 2:30 p.m. | ESPN+, SEC Network +\nSaturday, Nov. 9: at No. 18 Missouri*\nSaturday, Nov. 16: BYE\nSaturday, Nov. 23: vs. No. 7 Alabama*\nSaturday, Nov. 30: at No. 10 LSU*\n\n*Denotes SEC game\n\nTexas football schedule 2024\n\nHere’s a look at the Longhorns’ full 2024 football schedule, including dates, times and television designations:\n\nAll times Eastern.\n\nSaturday, Aug. 31: vs. Colorado State (W, 52-0)\nSaturday, Sept. 7: at No. 21 Michigan (W, 31-12)\nSaturday, Sept. 14: vs. UTSA (W, 56-7)\nSaturday, Sept. 21: vs. Louisiana Monroe (W, 51-3)\nSaturday, Sept. 28: vs. Mississippi State* (W, 35-13)\nSaturday, Oct. 5: BYE\nSaturday, Oct. 12: vs. No. 16 Oklahoma* | 3:30 p.m. | ABC (Fubo)\nSaturday, Oct. 19: vs. No. 4 Georgia* | 7:30 p.m. | ABC (Fubo)\nSaturday, Oct. 26: at Vanderbilt*\nSaturday, Nov. 2: BYE\nSaturday, Nov. 9: vs. Florida* | Noon | ABC or ESPN (Fubo)\nSaturday, Nov. 16: at Arkansas* | Noon | ABC or ESPN (Fubo)\nSaturday, Nov. 23: vs. Kentucky*\nSaturday, Nov. 30: at No. 14 Texas A&M*\n\n*Denotes SEC game\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

But he calmly boots home a 41-yard field goal to boost the Texas lead, and the Longhorn faithful packed into the west end of the Cotton Bowl are feeling pretty good, even if beer sales end at the end of the third quarter.\n\n8:25 3Q: Texas 21, Oklahoma 3\n\nA curious sequence by Texas at OU's 10-yard line keeps the Sooners' hopes alive. Texas faced a third-and-2, and Quinn Ewers missed two throws. Surprisingly, no rushing attempts on either snap. Can Oklahoma's offense help it's defense out?\n\n12:06 3Q: Texas 21, Oklahoma 3\n\nTexas safety Derek Williams Jr. returned after missing the past two games with a hamstring injury, but he had to be helped off after the opening kickoff of the second half while favoring his knee.\n\nHalftime: Texas 21, Oklahoma 3\n\nBert Auburn misses on a 44-yard field-goal try to end the half. The Longhorns converted on a fourth-and-2 at the 14-yard line on a run by Jaydon Blue, but a holding call on tight end Gunnar Helm pushed Texas back. Credit Texas safety Derek Williams Jr. for setting up the attempt after he stripped Taylor Tatum and recovered the fumble.\n\n1:40 2Q: Texas 21, Oklahoma 3\n\nIt's a Longhorn avalanche in the waning moments of the first half. Anthony Hill Jr. strips OU quarterback Michael Hawkins Jr. on a scramble, and defensive tackle Vernon Broughton pounces on the looose ball. One play later, Quintrevion Wisner rips off a 43-yard touchdown run. No fumbles this time.\n\n2:21 2Q: Texas 14, Oklahoma 3\n\nA Texas touchdown in a most unlikely way. Quintrevion Wisner gets loose for a 36-yard run, but Sooner defensive back Robert Spears-Jennings punches the ball out at the 10-yard line. As the ball bounces toward the back of the end zone and a possible touchback, Longhorn receiver Silas Bolden hustles downfield and recovers the fumble before it bounces out of the end zone. As Chris Fowler said on ESPN: \"Wacky stuff at Red River. Always have to expect it.\"\n\n8:48 2Q: Texas 7, Oklahoma 3\n\nThe Texas pass rush is starting to make itself felt. Barryn Sorrell had a sack to snuff an OU drive, and the Longhorns now have two official sacks. It must feel like more to OU freshman QB Michael Hawkins Jr., the first true freshman to ever start in this game for the Sooners.\n\n11:20 2Q: Texas 7, Oklahoma 3\n\nThe Texas offense wakes up on an 11-play, 75-yard drive capped by a throwback pass from Quinn Ewers to Gunnar Helm for a 7-yard score. Ewers hit DeAndre Moore Jr. for a 26-yard completion and Helm for a 21-yard completion on the drive.\n\nEnd 1Q: Oklahoma 3, Texas 0\n\nThe story of the game so far? The Oklahoma defense. The Longhorns have eight yards on their first three drives without a drive and an interception.\n\n0:10 1Q: Oklahoma 3, Texas 0\n\nOklahoma's Tyler Keltner nails a 42-yard field goal to give the Sooners the lead. So far, this OU defense has throttled Quinn Ewers and the Texas offense. The Longhorns have eight yards on their first three drives.\n\n4:52 1Q: Texas 0, Oklahoma 0\n\nIn its first three drives, the Texas offense has eight yards and no first downs with one interception. No, impatient Longhorn fan, we don't see Arch Manning warming up on the sidelines.\n\n7:04 1Q: Texas 0, Oklahoma 0\n\nSo far, the Texas defense has met two big challenges. Oklahoma started its second possession at midfield after a personal foul call against Texas on a punt return, but a perfectly timed blitz and a sack by safety Michael Taaffe sent the Sooners backwards. Let's see if Quinn Ewers can settle down for Texas after missing some open receivers on the Longhorns' first two drives.\n\n11:40 1Q: Texas 0, Oklahoma 0\n\nTexas defense holds on its first test. OU's Tyler Keltner misses on a 44-yard field-goal try. Oklahoma coach Brent Venables bypassed a chance to go for it on fourth-and-4, a decision that feels very much like a defensive-coordinator move.\n\nthe first snap of the game then missed a wide-open Matthew Golden on third down. Even worse? The pass sailed into the arms of OU safety Billy Bowman for an interception.\n\n13:43 1Q: Texas 0, Oklahoma 0\n\nA nightmare start for Quinn Ewers. The Texas quarterback, back in action for the first time since Week 3, took a sack on the first snap of the game then missed a wide-open Matthew Golden on third down. Even worse? The pass sailed into the arms of OU safety Billy Bowman for an interception.\n\nHow has Quinn Ewers fared after coming back from injury?\n\nHow has Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers played after coming back from injuries in each of the past two seasons? Not bad, based on the numbers. After missing three games in 2022, Ewers completed 21 of 31 passes for 289 yards and four touchdowns with one interception in a 49-0 win over Oklahoma. In 2023, Ewers threw for 317 yards and a touchdown with an interception on 22-for-33 passing in a 29-26 win over TCU after missing two games.\n\nTexas punter Michael Kern, safety Derek Williams Jr. ready to go\n\nAfter being listed as questionable for most of the week on the Texas availability report, punter Michael Kern has been cleared on Saturday's final injury report. So has Longhorn safety Derek Williams Jr., who was listed as questionable earlier this week. Kern has impressed in limited opportunities as a freshman, averaging 42.8 yards on 11 punts and placing four of those punts inside the 20-yard line. Williams, a sophomore, rotated in at the safety spot through the first three weeks but hasn't played since suffering an injury against UTSA in the third week of the season.\n\nTexas punter Michael Kern upgraded to probable\n\nAfter being listed as questionable for most of the week on the Texas availability report, punter Michael Kern has been upgraded to probable for Saturday's game against Oklahoma. Kern has impressed in limited opportunities this season, averaging 42.8 yards on 11 punts and placing four of those punts inside the 20-yard line. He has forced punt returners into five fair catches and doesn’t have a touchback. He also handles the holding duties on extra points and field goals.\n\nQuinn Ewers to start for Texas vs Oklahoma\n\nTexas quarterback Quinn Ewers, a Heisman Trophy candidate and a three-year starter for the Longhorns (5-0, 1-0 SEC), has missed the past two-and-a-half games with an abdominal strain. He will be back under center and is 1-1 versus the Sooners in his career.\n\n25 STARTS IN: How Quinn Ewers compares to recent Longhorns greats\n\nCollege GameDay coming to Texas vs Georgia\n\nIt was announced Saturday morning that ESPN's College GameDay will be on the Texas campus next weekend for a top-five matchup.

The results from last weekend's slate of college football games suggest that this game will be close. Guess what? The 120th meeting between Texas and Oklahoma will be close.

      "content": "Red River Beatdown: Longhorns dominate Oklahoma, set up Georgia showdown\nGetty Images\nShare or Save for Later\nTexas Longhorns ride defense, strong running game in dominant win over rival Oklahoma Sooners with Georgia Bulldogs up next in SEC race\nMike Craven\nOct 12 1:51 pm\n\nDALLAS, TX – The team north of the Red River is now the one that flinches. \n\nTexas (6-0, 2-0) walked out of the State Fair Street Fight with the Golden Hat and a second 30-plus point win over the Sooners in the last three seasons.  It used to be the other way around, as former Oklahoma (4-2, 1-2) great Baker Mayfield told a young Keondre Coburn back in 2018. \n\nAnd he was right at the time. For years, it was Texas that showed up to the State Fair in Dallas unwilling or unprepared to last four quarters in the Cotton Bowl. No longer. \n\nTexas punked Oklahoma, 49-0, in 2022. The Longhorns bloodied the Sooners once again in 2024, scoring the last 34 points to win 34-3. The first quarter was scary for the burnt orange as the returning Quinn Ewers was intercepted in his first pass thrown since the first half of the Week 3 win over UTSA. Texas trailed 3-0 at the end of the first quarter. \n\nThe Longhorns didn’t earn a single first down or rushing yard over the first 15 minutes of the game. Oklahoma out gained them 54 yards to 13 in the first quarter. Texas out gained the Sooners 393 to 183 the rest of the way, and 98 of Oklahoma’s 183 yards over the last three quarters came in garbage time in the fourth quarter when most of the Sooner faithful was in line for a corny dog and a wax cup beer to drown their tears. \n\nTHREE THINGS WE LEARNED \n\nTexas can win with defense: The Longhorns don’t need Ewers to be the best quarterback in the country to win the SEC. The junior returned from injury in a pedestrian performance, completing 20 of 29 passes for 199 yards, 1 TD, and 1 INT. He found nine different receivers on the day with one going for over 30 yards. The Longhorn offense sputtered early with 10 plays for 13 yards in the first quarter, including that interception on the first throw of the game. Oklahoma’s starting field position over their first three drives was their own 48, but the Longhorns only allowed three points to keep the burnt orange anxiety low as the offense found its footing. \n\nTexas rarely wins in the Red River Rivalry without a stellar performance from the quarterback. A great sign for the Longhorns is that they no longer need to win high-scoring affairs every week because they might possess the best defense in college football. The unit has only allowed three touchdowns in 24 quarters this season. Texas is allowing 6.33 points per game through six games and are playing at a level the Forty Acres hasn’t seen in over 40 years. \n\nOklahoma gained 237 yards on 69 plays. The Sooners was 4 of 15 on third down. Quarterback Michael Hawkins was 19 of 30 for 148 yards while adding 27 yards rushing on 20 carries. The Texas defense held Oklahoma to 2.3 yards rushing on 39 carries. In a series that is highly unpredictable, one truth remains universal – the team that runs the ball better leaves the State Fair victorious. Texas outran Oklahoma, 177-89. \n\nSophomore Anthony Hill Jr. is the best second-level defender at Texas since Derrick Johnson. He finished the game with 11 tackles, including two sacks and three tackles for loss. He also forced a fumble. True freshman Colin Simmons was second on the team with five tackles, including 1.5 for loss. Both are from Dallas-Fort Worth. The improved Texas secondary continued to shine. Michael Taaffe recorded an important first quarter sack. Derrick Williams forced and recovered a fumble late in the second quarter. Jaylon Guilbeau, Malik Muhammad, and Jahdae Barron were blankets. \n\nTexas used to be known as a Country Club program. A place with great wide receivers and quarterbacks but not enough beef. The Longhorns used to be the punching bags. But the defense and offensive line flipped the narrative for the second time in three years against Oklahoma, and that’s scary hours for the rest of the SEC. \n\nTre Wisner is RB1: With all the talk about a quarterback controversy that doesn’t exist, one offensive player does appear to have taken the reins at an important position on the Texas offense. Wisner, a sophomore who won a state championship at DeSoto in 2022, has emerged as the best running back on Texas’s roster. The unit went looking for a new RB1 when Jonathan Brooks went to the NFL and expected incumbent C.J. Baxter suffered a season-ending injury before the season. \n\nJunior Jayden Blue was assumed to be the top ball carrier for the Longhorns in 2024 but a pair of fumbles against Mississippi State left the door cracked for Wisner, who blew the doors open with 118 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries. Blue gained 30 yards on 10 carries against Oklahoma. Wisner might not possess Blue’s speed and athleticism, but he’s a patient runner with better vision and a penchant for gaining an extra yard or two on every carry. \n\nTexas needs both Blue and Wisner in the second half of the season, but don’t be shocked if more carries go to the sophomore. \n\nTexas is the SEC favorite: It is okay to admit, Texas fans. This is the best team in the SEC. Alabama lost to Vanderbilt last week and tried to lose to South Carolina in Week 7. That Crimson Tide squad knocked off Georgia a few weeks ago, and the Bulldogs looked sluggish in a win over Mississippi State today. Tennessee lost to Arkansas and didn’t dominate Oklahoma in the way Texas did. Ole Miss and LSU have holes. Who else but the Longhorns could be considered the SEC favorite through seven weeks of the 2024 season? \n\nThe win over Oklahoma set up a Top 5 matchup on Oct. 19 as the Longhorns host the Bulldogs at 6:30 p.m. in one of the biggest games at DKR in modern times. A win over Georgia doesn’t just mean Texas is the clear SEC favorite. It’ll indicate that the top-ranked Horns are the best team in the country. \n\nDon't Miss Any Exclusive Coverage!\n\nWe've been the Bible of Texas football fans for 64 years.

First-ranked and undefeated Texas was on its back foot against Oklahoma, the team the Longhorns were expected to beat handily.\n\nIn previous years, when the higher-ranked team often left the Cotton Bowl attempting to understand how it had somehow lost, such a start would have portended an ominous end.\n\nBut not this year.\n\nThe Longhorns went on to beat the 18th-ranked Sooners, 34-3, by rarely making such mistakes again.\n\nGunnar Helm #85 of the Texas Longhorns dives for a touchdown during the second quarter against the Oklahoma Sooners at Cotton Bowl Stadium in Dallas on Saturday.Sam Hodde / Getty Images\n\nLate in the second quarter, leading 14-3, Texas forced fumbles on consecutive Oklahoma drives to lead 21-3 at the half.\n\nFor a Sooners offense that lacked a passing game and knew its margin for error was already slim, the turnovers before halftime effectively ended any threat and turned a rivalry whose history is rife with unexpected outcomes into a result that should shock nobody.\n\nRecommended\n2024 ELECTION\nDNC to skywrite 'Vote Kamala' over the Raiders-Steelers game Sunday\nSOCCER\nU.S. men's soccer begins Pochettino era with 2-0 friendly win over Panama\n\nPlaying his first game since returning from an oblique strain that sidelined him for two games, Ewers looked overwhelmed early, but ended with 199 passing yards, completing 20 of his 29 passes.\n\nHe threw for one touchdown and rushed for another. Texas (6-0) was further helped by Quintrevion Wisner’s 118 rushing yards, including a 43-yard touchdown run, and only five penalties.\n\nThe result made clear that Oklahoma (4-2) could again struggle under coach Brent Venables. Once a factory that produced Heisman Trophy-caliber quarterbacks, the Sooners entered Saturday with the 119th-ranked passing offense, and Michael Hawkins rarely threatened by completing 19 of his 30 passes. Oklahoma’s rushing attack also produced only 2.3 yards per carry.\n\nHarder to discern is how much the Longhorns’ rout of Oklahoma revealed about the strength of Texas as a national-title contender.\n\nThis season, it has won by an average margin of 36.8 points, but whether that says more about the strength of Texas or the underwhelming nature of its schedule remains unclear. Its two best victories, on the road at Michigan and at a neutral site against Oklahoma, were impressive given the Longhorns’ level of control, yet came against teams that are considerably flawed.\n\nLife in Texas’ previous conference, the Big 12, meant that beating Oklahoma was the toughest hurdle to reaching the conference title game. In the SEC, that’s no longer the case. Next week, the Longhorns host Georgia.\n\nBeating the Sooners earned Texas bragging rights. The Bulldogs, however, will be a truer championship litmus test.\n\nAndrew Greif\n\nAndrew Greif is a freelance sports journalist. ",

      "content": "After tough South Carolina win, what's next for Alabama football in SEC play?\nCOLIN GAY   Tuscaloosa News\n\nTim Smith was not surprised with how tough Saturday’s win against South Carolina was for Alabama football. \n\nThe Alabama graduate defensive end has been navigating SEC schedules since 2020. He’s been a part of four SEC regular-season losses since his arrival at Alabama: Texas A&M in 2021, Tennessee and LSU in 2022, and Vanderbilt in 2024. \n\nSo when an SEC team comes to Bryant-Denny Stadium to play Alabama, Smith knows exactly what the Crimson Tide will get. \n\n“We play at Alabama, you know what I’m saying?” Smith said. “We everybody’s Super Bowl.” \n\nAnd for the past 10 quarters, Alabama has seen SEC teams’ bests, from the second-half comeback by Georgia to the four-quarter collapse against Vanderbilt and Saturday’s narrow win against the Gamecocks. \n\nSmith said he knows what outsiders say. He harkens back to Alabama coach Nick Saban, calling other thoughts and opinions “rat poison.” \n\n“But when it comes to us, when they play us, you might not recognize who the team is,” Smith said. “They came out to ball and beat our behinds. That’s one of the fantastic things about the SEC: Everybody wants our head.” \n\nThat narrative has continued through the Saban era and into Kalen DeBoer’s. \n\nOn ESPN’s “College GameDay,” Saban said he saw “a little bit of complacency, almost even arrogance” from the Crimson Tide after the Georgia game and into Vanderbilt week.\n\nAfter what Alabama saw from Vanderbilt, and from the scare South Carolina gave the Crimson Tide Saturday, a familiar refrain rang out from inside the Alabama locker room. \n\n“We talk about it all the time, it’s hard to win in the SEC,” Alabama running back Justice Haynes said. “They are a really good team, and they took care of it today. That’s all we can ask.” \n\nIt’s a mindset that keeps Alabama grounded in a conference that came into Saturday with nine teams in the latest top-25 of the US LBM Coaches Poll including future opponents Tennessee, Missouri, LSU and Oklahoma. \n\nAlabama still has notoriety in the SEC with what Saban built across 17 seasons in Tuscaloosa. But it’s a reputation that has hit somewhat of a roadblock over the course of DeBoer’s first six games with the Crimson Tide, especially over the past 10 quarters of conference play. \n\nIn the past 10 quarters, Alabama has either looked beatable or been beaten. And as Alabama faces the meat of SEC play — what could be four ranked games in five weeks — adversity remains for the Crimson Tide, something wide receiver Germie Bernard said the team always talks about. \n\n“I mean, we knew it would come,” Bernard said. “It just depends on how you respond. We responded well this week and, I mean, we will just continue to fix things in practice that we need throughout next week and play a better game.”\n\nColin Gay covers Alabama football for The Tuscaloosa News, part of the USA TODAY Network.

There’s some things that we can do to make sure it doesn’t get to that point. But we always talk about finding a way to win. As many times as it looked like we weren’t, we did.”\n\nWith 43 seconds remaining, Sellers hit Nyck Harbor for a 31-yard touchdown, but the Gamecocks (3-2, 1-3) failed to convert on their two-point attempt. They recovered the ensuing onside kick, but Sellers' desperation heave toward the end zone with 13 seconds remaining was intercepted at the goal line by Jackson.\n\n“We expected to win this game,\" South Carolina coach Shane Beamer said. “Nobody was coming in here at halftime doing cartwheels because we were in a tight game with Alabama. We expected that, because we have a good football team. Life in this conference is really hard.”\n\nJalen Milroe rushed for a 7-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter and then hit Germie Bernard for a late 34-yard score to help Alabama survive the scare. It wasn't quite the emphatic rebound win they were hoping to produce.\n\n“It’s not the ‘W’ that we wanted,” Alabama defensive lineman Tim Smith said. “It should have been a lot more dominant and physical, but a ‘W’ is a ‘W,’ man.”\n\nMilroe delivered when he had to in a game where he was intercepted twice and flagged for intentional grounding on a sack in the end zone for a safety. Facing third-and-10, he found Bernard downfield without a defender anywhere in the vicinity with 1:54 left to cap a 10-play drive.\n\n“There was a lot of safe avenues and things that we discussed on that play and I think that they were aggressive in trying to play a lot of those,” DeBoer said. “There was a deeper route and I love that Jalen saw it.”\n\nMilroe was 16-of-23 passing for 209 yards with a touchdown and two rushing scores. Sellers was 23 of 31 for 238 yards with two TDs and the final pick.\n\nThe Gamecocks entered the fourth quarter with a lead and had a chance to retake it. But Alex Herrera's 51-yard field goal attempt, which would have been a career long, was short.\n\nMilroe had taken advantage of a Sellers fumble with his 7-yard touchdown run with 10:42 left but the two-point pass failed, leaving it 20-19.\n\nHe was relegated to cheerleader at the end with the defense on the field, just like against Vandy and Georgia.\n\n“When we talk about team, that’s a great example of just finding a way as a group to just cheer on whoever’s on the field and everyone just buying in,” Milroe said.\n\nAlabama's 14-0 lead was whittled down to two over the final 1:37 before halftime amid a series of South Carolina's big plays and Tide snafus. It included the safety, turnovers from each team and Sellers’ fourth-and-9 pass to a wide-open Mazeo Bennett Jr. for a 36-yard score.\n\n“There was some crazy stuff but our guys just kept hanging in there,” Beamer said.\n\nThe takeaway\n\nSouth Carolina: The Gamecocks largely turned things around after a 27-3 home loss to No. 9 Mississippi, with Sellers outplaying Milroe for much of the way.\n\nAlabama: That dominant first half and win over Georgia seems like a different season now. But like that game, the Tide managed to hold on.\n\nPoll implications\n\nAlabama could fall in the rankings despite the win.\n\nUp next\n\nSouth Carolina: At No. 18 Oklahoma on Saturday, Oct. 19.\n\nAlabama: At No. 8 Tennessee on Saturday, Oct. 19.\n\n------\n\nGet alerts on the latest AP Top 25 poll throughout the season.

      "content": "No. 7 Alabama Football Survives Close Battle With South Carolina, 27-25\nThe Crimson Tide narrowly escaped the Gamecocks after falling to Vanderbilt last week.\nHunter De Siver | 16 Hours Ago\nOct 12, 2024; Tuscaloosa, Alabama, USA; Alabama Crimson Tide quarterback Jalen Milroe (4) carries the ball for a first down as he gets around South Carolina Gamecocks defensive back Jalon Kilgore (24) during the first half at Bryant-Denny Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Butch Dill-Imagn Images / Butch Dill-Imagn Images\nIn this story:\nAlabama Crimson Tide\n\nTUSCALOOSA, Ala.— Following a shocking upset loss to Vanderbilt for the first time since 1984, the now-No. 7-ranked Alabama Crimson Tide looked to rebound against South Carolina on Saturday at Saban Field at Bryant-Denny Stadium.\n\nHowever, the rebound wasn't a massive one by any means as Alabama narrowly escaped the Gamecocks 27-25, after a missed two-point conversion by South Carolina.\n\nAlabama held a 14-0 lead early after short rushing touchdowns by quarterback Jalen Milroe and running back Justice Haynes, but a 36-yard scoring connection between South Carolina quarterback LaNorris Sellers and wide receiver Mazeo Bennett Jr. on fourth-and-short cut the lead to seven with under two minutes remaining in the first half.\n\nNine seconds later, Milroe was quickly pressured in the endzone and his flag for intentional grounding resulted in a safety. Alabama's defense was able to get off the field quickly after, but Milroe threw an interception that was returned 31 yards before going out of bounds with one second left before the break, and South Carolina closed the half with a 37-yard field goal.\n\nThe Gamecocks couldn't have opened the second half any better as they went 5-for-5 on third down, including a one-yard score by running back Raheim Sanders to take the lead.\n\nMilroe and company were then able to drive downfield but he'd throw an endzone interception, causing some panic around the mecca of college football. However, Sellers went on to fumble it shortly after and defensive lineman LT Overton recovered. Following a 16-yard catch by Alabama wide receiver Ryan Williams, Milroe ran it in for six from seven yards out to reclaim a 20-19 lead (missed two-point conversion).\n\nA couple of long runs by Sanders got South Carolina into long field goal range, but the 51-yard attempt was no good.\n\nFrom there, the Crimson Tide was able to chew the clock with numerous first downs and a 37-yard touchdown reception by Germie Bernard.\n\nBut the Gamecocks wouldn't go away as wide receiver Nyck Harbor hauled in an incredible 31-yard touchdown reception, but South Carolina would miss the two-point conversion.\n\nDown by two with 40 seconds to go, South Carolina recovered the onside kick, sucking the air out of Saban Field at Bryant-Denny Stadium. However, Alabama cornerback Domani Jackson would snag the game-sealing interception as time expired.\n\nHow it Happened\n\nNEAREST UPDATES ARE AT THE TOP.\n\nFourth Quarter\n40 seconds left in regulation: South Carolina recovers the onside kick. However, Domani Jackson hauls in the interception to end the game.\n1:54 left in regulation: South Carolina quickly drives downfield with the drive culminating with an incredible 31-yard touchdown reception by wide receiver Nyck Harbor. However, the two-point converison was no good. ALABAMA 27, SOUTH CAROLINA 25.\n6:08 left in regulation: Milroe and the Tide are able to chew the clock with numerous first down and a 37-yard touchdown reception by Germie Bernard, ending the game and avoiding another upset. ALABAMA 27, SOUTH CAROLINA 19.\n10:42 left in regulation: Sanders runs for a combined 31 yards but the field goal attempt a few plays later does not split the uprights.\n12:05 left in regulation: Milroe connects with Williams for a 16-yard gain and then the dual-threat ran it into the endzone from seven yards out (3 plays, 31 yards, 1:23). The Crimson Tide didn't make the two-point conversion. ALABAMA 20, SOUTH CAROLINA 19.\n12:17 left in regulation: Moore is penalized with a pass interference on the first play. But then Sellers fumbles and Overton recovers.\n15:00 left in regulation: Alabama gets in the redzone but Milroe throws an interception in the endzone.\nThird Quarter\n1:19 left in third quarter: Milroe tallies a combined 22 all-purpose yards on two plays as the third quarter expires.\n3:13 left in the third quarter: South Carolina goes three-and-out with final play stemming from a sideline tackle by Lawson. Kroeger punts 37 yards to Alabama's 46-yard line.\n6:14 left in third quarter: Emmanuel Henderson Jr. fumbled the kick return after a big hit but cornerback Keon Sabb recovered. Adams hauled in a pass and ran it for 27-yard gain on the first play of the drive. Milroe then found Bernard a couple plays later on third down for a 13-yard gain, but that would follow with a seven-yard loss to Dippre who was picked up quickly after the catch and Burnip punts it 31 yards to SC's 11-yard line shortly after.\n15:00 left in third quarter: Sellers runs for a nine-yard gain on third-and-six. Sanders then gets a two-yard gain on third-and-short. Sellers scrambles and runs right for a 14-yard gain on the very next play. Defensive lineman Jah-Marien Latham proceeds to sack him for an 8-yard loss but Sellers then finds Bennett open in the middle for a 22-yard gain to convert another third down. The fourth third down conversion of the drive came on a shovel pass to running baxck Oscar Adaway III for a 14-yard gain. The fifth and final conversion was a one-yard touchdown run by Sanders (16 plays, 85 yards, 8:35). SOUTH CAROLINA 19, ALABAMA 14.\nSecond Quarter\n\nHalftime Stat Leaders:\n\nPassing: LaNorris Sellers - 13-of-16, 128 yards, one touchdown\nRushing: Justice Haynes - six attempts, 21 yards, one touchdown\nReceiving: Germie Bernard - two receptions, 42 yards\nDefensive: Kyle Kennard - five tackles, three for loss, two sacks\n48 seconds left in second quarter: Milroe throws an interception to Jalon Kilgore who returns it 31 yards before stepping out with one second remaining. Kroeger converts 37-yard field goal. ALABAMA 14, SOUTH CAROLINA 12.\n1:20 left in the second quarter: On the second play of the drive, Sellers is strip-sacked by Campbell and linebacker Keanu Koht recovers near midfield.\n1:37 left in the second quarter: Milroe is flagged for intentional grounding in the endzone, resulting in a safety. ALABAMA 14, SOUTH CAROLINA 9.\n4:38 left in the second quarter: South Carolina's numerous short and medium gains bring the Gamecocks to Alabama's 37-yard line. Cornerback Zavier Mincey adds a tackle to his young career and fellow freshman cornerback Jaylen Mbakwe gets a tackle for loss on a quick pass on third down. South Carolina converts on 4th-and-9 with a 36-yard touchdown connection between Sellers and wide receiver Mazeo Bennett Jr. ALABAMA 14, SOUTH CAROLINA 7.\n8:10 left in the second quarter: Alabama running back Jam Miller gets a combined 27 all-purpose yards on the first three plays of the drive and Milroe matches that number with one long run. Milroe then ran on two more consecutive plays and Haynes finished the 7-plays, 67-yard, 3:32 drive with a two-yard rushing touchdown. ALABAMA 14, SOUTH CAROLINA 0.\n9:45 left in the second quarter: Gamecocks commit a false start on the first play and backup quarterback Robby Ashford follows it with a nine-yard run. A couple plays later on third-and-nine, Sellers escapes a ton of pressure and sees wide receiver Gage Larvadain getting open downfield but he can't come up with the catch and South Carolina's Kai Kroeger punts 54 yards to Alabama's 33-yard line.\n12:07 left in the second quarter: Alabama running back rushes for a 7-yard gain on second-and-short, but Milroe is sacked a couple plays later on third down to force a 52-yard Burnip punt to SC's 12-yard line\n15:00 left in the second quarter: The Gamecocks continue with the ball to open the second period. Sellers is then sacked by linebackers Que Robinson and Jordan Renaud to create a third down, but on the next play, a roughing the passer by linebacker Jihaad Campbell extends the drive. Defensive tackle Tim Smith sacks Sellers a couple plays later on third down, but they go for it and defensive back DeVonta Smith forces Gamecocks tight end Joshua Simon to fumble which is picked up by safety Malachi Moore at Alabama's 27-yard line.

Milroe then finds tight end CJ Dippre for 19 yards but it's called back due to Bernard's ineligibility downfield. South Carolina brings heavy pressure on third down a couple plays later and sacks Milroe. Burnip punts 59 yards and defensive back King Mack is all over the returner at the 10-yard line.\n11:00 left in first quarter: Following a pass breakup by Alabama linebacker Justin Jefferson, South Carolina quarterback LaNorris Sellers connected with running back Raheim Sanders for a 14-yard gain. However, numerous Crimson Tide defenders would reach the backfield a couple of plays later on third-down and Deontae Lawson got the credit for a three-yard tackle for loss on Sellers to force a punt.\n15:00 left in first quarter: Alabama running back Justice Haynes gets the first three touches for a combined nine yards. Quarterback Jalen Milroe sneaks for a first down to extend the drive. Wide receivers Germie Bernard and Cole Adams each had catches of 30 yards.

      "content": "Alabama head coach Kalen DeBoer addresses the media after the Tide holds off South Carolina, 27-25\nBy Matt Stahl | mstahl@al.com\n\nAlabama football’s Saturday win over South Carolina was closer than most Crimson Tide fans would have preferred. UA sealed the game on the final play, when Domani Jackson intercepted a heave from USC’s LaNorris Sellers to preserve the 27-25 victory.\n\nA win is a win in the SEC, especially when you’re coming off a loss to Vanderbilt. Still the Tide showed some major flaws against the Gamecocks.\n\n0:04\n/\n4:30\nKeep Watching\nBamaCentral Instant Analysis: Alabama 27, South Carolina 25\n\nHere are our grades for Saturday’s effort.\n\nOffense: C-\n\nThe offense got the job done. With the chips on the line, Jalen Milroe found Germie Bernard on third down for a touchdown that ended up as the winning score.\n\nBut it was an imperfect effort from Alabama. The Crimson Tide once again struggled to sustain drives at times, but it also didn’t have as much of the home run punch that defined its offense in the first several games of the season.\n\nMilroe threw two ugly interceptions that made the effort look even worse. Protection was suspect at times, and Milroe was sacked four times.\n\nJust like the rest of the team, Alabama got the job done offensively. But it wasn’t pretty.\n\nDefense: C\n\nJackson made the play that mattered. As the clock ticked down, he tracked down a Sellers pass deep, and picked it off, then ran out the clock.\n\nBut that came after a struggle of a second half for Alabama. The Tide couldn’t get off the field on third down, for the second game in a row, which made things far more difficult than they needed to be.\n\nAlabama also had trouble stopping a mobile quarterback for the second game in a row, and had some key coverage busts. There’s issues that need to be fixed going forward, with Tennessee up next.\n\nSpecial teams: D\n\nNot great. Other than James Burnip, who was excellent, as usual, and the only thing keeping the Alabama special teams from an outright “F.”\n\nHowever, the Crimson Tide had multiple chances to fall on South Carolina’s onside kick and end the game, but couldn’t capitalize. There’s also the penalties.\n\nMalachi Moore was offsides on Burnip’s post-safety kick. The Tide also lost 12 yards on an unnecessary roughness call in the first half that backed the UA offense up and had a hand in causing Milroe’s intentional grounding penalty safety in the end zone.\n\nThe Tide has had multiple special teams gaffes this season. Those have to stop.\n\nOverall: C-\n\nAlabama won the game. For that, it gets a passing grade, albeit not one most would rush home to show their parents.\n\nThe Crimson Tide has flaws that could be fatal when it faces more difficult opponents. But it got the win Saturday, and that’s not nothing.\n\nSEE MORE FROM AL.COM'S CRIMSON TIDE BEAT WRITERS\nHow Domani Jackson’s resolve led Alabama football to win over South Carolina\nSouth Carolina’s Shane Beamer talks 2-point attempt, LaNorris Sellers after loss to Alabama football\nKalen DeBoer talks Alabama football’s defensive 3rd down issues\nWhat Kalen DeBoer said about Alabama's costly penalties vs. South Carolina\nAlabama football’s Kalen DeBoer explains 1st half timeout that led to South Carolina points\n\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

      "content": "Alabama Football survives South Carolina: 3 takeaways\nAlabama Football had to come from behind in the fourth quarter to edge South Carolina and avoid a second straight regular season loss for the first time since 2007.\nBy John Mitchell | Oct 12, 2024\nOct 12, 2024; Tuscaloosa, Alabama, USA; South Carolina Gamecocks linebacker Bam Martin-Scott (22) pursues Alabama Crimson Tide wide receiver Germie Bernard (5) as he carries the ball down the field during the first quarter at Bryant-Denny Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Will McLelland-Imagn Images / Will McLelland-Imagn Images\n\nIt wasn't the bounceback performance that Alabama Football fans were hoping for, but the Crimson Tide dug deep to get a win over South Carolina to move to 5-1 on the season.\n\nAlabama jumped out to a 14-0 lead in the first half, but a disastorous final five minutes of the 2nd quarter allowed the Gamecocks to claw back into it.\n\nOn a fourth-and-9 from the Tide 36, Alabama dropped back into coverage instead of blitzing and South Carolina QB LaNorris Sellers hit a wide open Mazeo Bennett for a touchdown. Compounding the mistake, following a penalty on kick off, Milroe had an intentional grounding in the endzone that foced a safety.\n\nThen, following a takeaway by the defense, and facing a third and long near midfield, Milroe was intercepted, allowing the Gamecocks to tack on a field goal to cut the lead to 14-12.\n\nThe Gamecocks took a long touchdown drive to open the third quarter and take a 19-14 lead that left the Bryant-Denny crowd totally stunned.\n\nMilroe threw an interception in the endzone when Alabama was poised to take the lead back, but the defense got another takeaway to set up the go-ahead touchdown - a seven yard run by Milroe.\n\nThe defense stood tall one more time, forcing the Gamecocks into a 51-yard FG attempt that went begging. Alabama scored again on a gutsy third-and-10 call that Milroe connected with Bernard for 34-yards.\n\nBernard could have taken a knee and ended the game instead of scoring because aided by a facemask penalty on Que Robinson, the Gamecocks went down the field and scored a touchdown.\n\nEven after stopping the two point conversion, Alabama couldn't make it easy. The Gamecocks recovered an onside kick that bounced off of TWO Alabama players. Three consecutive blitzes by the defense led to an interception by Domani Jackson to end the game.\n\nThree Takeaways from the Alabama win:\n3. A tale of two defenses\n\nThe defense played better this week. That point should be known. But it was a tale of two play-calls. When Alabama blitzed, they had success. When they didn't, South Carolina made plays. It was really that simple.\n\nThe fourth down touchdown in the first half to give the Gamecocks life was because Alabama couldn't get pressure on a slow developing pass play, and a young defense busted on the back end. There's far too many freshmen playing meaningful snaps in the secondary to leave them on an island for long.\n\nIt was the same thing on the touchdown to Nyck Harbor that cut the lead to two. No pressure, and somehow no safety help over the top, and it's a 50-50 ball where Domani Jackson is severely outmatched.\n\nBut at the end of the game following the onside kick, Alabama brought pressure three consecutive snaps. It forced a tipped ball at the line, a throwaway, and then the game ending interception.\n\nWith what the staff is working with in the secondary, Alabama needs to be the most aggressive defense in the country. Wommack should be calling blitzes 70% of the time, at minimum moving forward, unless by some magic Alabama is able to start getting pressure with four.\n\nI said it last week, particularly with how boom-or-bust the offense can be, the defense has to match that tone.\n\nThe scheme isn't the problem. The play calling is.\n\n2. Heads up play by Domani Jackson at the end\n\nOn the interception, Jackson's momentum carried him into the endzone, which should mean he can take a knee and it be a touchback, game over.\n\nBut Jackson checked with the ref, the ref didn't give him the nod that he was good, and instead of leaving it up to the official to make a call that could have resulted in a safety and a tied game, Jackson got out of the endzone.\n\nHe gave up the touchdown to Harbor, but overall Jackson has had a nice season. His injury in the first half was a tough loss for a young secondary, but thankfully he was able to get back into the game and made the winning play.\n\n1. Every game outside of Mercer will look like this\n\nThis team seemingly has no ability to step on a team's throat and finish the job. There's no excuse that this was as competitive as it was. It boils down to coaching and execution in these moments, and Alabama isn't doing a good enough job of either.\n\nThe end of half sequence was a disaster that can be placed squarely at Kalen DeBoer's feet. The last five points were completely avoidable, and could have ultimately been the difference in the game.\n\nThe rest of the season will probably look similar based on this concerning trend pointed out on Twitter:\n\nThe SEC is too talented across the board to get away with some of the stuff Alabama got away with today. It won't work next week at Tennessee. It won't work later at LSU or Oklahoma. It might not even work in home games against Missouri and Auburn.\n\nLosing to Vanderbilt last week showed us, and today against South Carolina proved it. There's no gimme games left for this team in the SEC.\n\nNEXT: The return of an unfortunate buzz word for Alabama Football\nHome\n/\nAlabama Football",

      "content": "COLLEGE FOOTBALL\nOregon-Ohio State is a reminder of why College Football Playoff expansion is a good thing\nThe matchup was a sign of the current times in college football — a pair of veteran, transfer quarterbacks leading teams separated by nearly 2,500 miles, yet facing off in league play thanks to conference realignment. \nOregon Ducks wide receiver Tez Johnson (15) celebrates a touchdown by Oregon Ducks wide receiver Evan Stewart (7) in the second quarter during a game against the Ohio State Buckeyes on Saturday.Brian Murphy/Icon Sportswire / Getty Images\nOct. 13, 2024, 5:30 AM GMT+2\nBy Andrew Greif\n\nIn a recent custom at the University of Oregon, its fans spend the minutes between the third and fourth quarters singing “Shout,” an ode to “Animal House,” which was filmed on the Eugene, Oregon, campus.\n\nThey were shouting again Saturday. And by the end, that noise became screams. \n\nFans stormed the field inside Autzen Stadium after third-ranked Oregon outlasted second-ranked Ohio State, 32-31, the second time during this college football season that a meeting of top-10 teams wasn’t decided until the final play.\n\nWeeks after Alabama beat Georgia in an instant classic, the Ducks (6-0) remained unbeaten when Ohio State (5-1), given the ball for one last drive with 1:47 remaining in the fourth quarter, was pushed out of field goal range and saw their last play break down before Will Howard could even attempt a potential end zone heave.\n\nThe matchup was a sign of the current times in college football — a pair of veteran, transfer quarterbacks leading teams separated by nearly 2,500 miles, yet facing off in league play thanks to conference realignment. \n\nAnd this is a matchup that could happen again, in two months, thanks to the expansion of the College Football Playoff. After the first top-five matchup lived up to the hype, who’s up for a rematch in a few months? \n\nHoward completed 28 of his 35 passes for 326 yards and two touchdowns. He dueled with Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabriel, who completed 23 of his 34 passes for 341 yards and also two touchdowns.\n\nUntil the final drive, the difference between teams was so small as to appear nonexistent.\n\nRecommended\n2024 ELECTION\nDNC to skywrite 'Vote Kamala' over the Raiders-Steelers game Sunday\nSOCCER\nU.S. men's soccer begins Pochettino era with 2-0 friendly win over Panama\n\nOregon finished with 14 more rushing yards and 15 more passing yards. Ohio State had the game’s only turnover. Ohio State led 7-6 after one quarter, Oregon 22-21 at halftime, and Ohio State 31-29 with 1:54 to play, as the Ducks faced third and goal, two yards from the end zone and the lead. That run barely gained a yard but led to a 19-yard field goal that pushed Oregon ahead, 32-31. \n\nIt would stand as the game-winning kick when Ohio State’s final drive ended after eight plays and 49 yards, stuck 38 yards from the end zone. Since these teams first met 66 years ago, Ohio State won the first nine matchups, but Oregon has claimed the last two.\n\nIn previous eras, Saturday would have effectively served as a knockout game for the loser’s chances of advancing to the College Football Playoff. That level of pressure on every weekend helped to fuel the sport’s popularity, while also differentiating it from the NFL. \n\nBut Saturday’s back-and-forth result was an example of why the expansion of the playoff this year — to 12 teams — could endure as a good thing. For exactly 60 minutes, both teams looked to be among the very best the country has seen this season. The expansion ensures both, and not only the winner, will have the opportunity to prove that in December, and potentially January, instead of penalizing one for a result on the second weekend in October.\n\nAnd that just might be something worth shouting about.\n\nAndrew Greif\n\nAndrew Greif is a freelance sports journalist. ",

Credit: Samuel Cipriani | Asst. Sports Editor\n\nThe Buckeyes had long circled their matchup with No. 3 Oregon, knowing it would be their biggest test of the season to date.\n\nIt was, however, a test they ultimately failed.\n\nAfter a pseudo onside kick, an Oregon player ejected for spitting on Davison Igbinosun and eight lead changes, Ohio State lost a heartbreaker 32-31 after quarterback Will Howard seemed to mismanage the clock as time ran out. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the Buckeyes down by a point with 1:46 remaining, Howard led Ohio State down the field to the Oregon 43-yard line with six seconds remaining and one timeout. The quarterback evaded pressure, scrambled up the middle and slid down as time expired.\n\n“It sucks,” Howard said. “You don’t want to lose a game like that. I don’t know what we could’ve done better, I could’ve gotten down earlier, gave us a chance; it would’ve been a longer kick.”\n\nHoward finished the game 28-of-35 for 326 yards and two touchdowns. Linebacker Cody Simon led the defense with 10 total tackles.\n\n“This is a team loss,” Ohio State head coach Ryan Day said. “The offense had a chance to go in and finish it off at the end but it didn’t happen. It felt like we were in field goal range there, and we wanted to keep adding to the field goal because every time you add five yards it increases [your chances].\n\nIn his career, Day is 1-7 against top-five teams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“You take a brutal penalty like that that pushes you back — it’s heartbreaking, but that’s football,” Day said.\n\nThe first half brought four lead changes, numerous scoring opportunities and more bizarre plays than the Buckeyes have seen through their first five games, all of which could’ve helped Ohio State come out on top.\n\nHoward rushed for a 1-yard touchdown to put the Buckeyes ahead 7-0 five minutes into the game.\n\nFour minutes later, Oregon defensive lineman Derrick Harmon stripped the ball from Buckeyes running back Quinshon Judkins, and two plays later, Ducks running back Jordan James was in the endzone.\n\nInstead of tying the game at seven apiece, Oregon punter Luke Dunne botched the hold on the extra point, leaving the Buckeyes with a 7-6 lead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe half only got weirder from there.\n\nOhio State quickly punted the ball back to the Ducks after committing three pre-snap penalties to push them behind the sticks, but again, the Buckeyes were bailed out by a Ducks special team mistake.\n\nOregon kicker Atticus Sappington pushed a 44-yard field goal right of the uprights, and Henderson followed with a 53-yard rush. Judkins plowed into the end zone, pushing the Buckeyes to a 14-6 lead.\n\nDucks quarterback Dillon Gabriel found wide receiver Evan Stewart, who got behind cornerback Denzel Burke for a 69-yard grab down the sideline, followed by a miraculous catch by Stewart in the corner of the endzone. \n\nThe Ducks failed at a two-point conversion to tie the game, keeping the score 14-12 Buckeyes. But cornerback Jordan Hancock committed a 15-yard personal foul after the play, allowing the Ducks to kick off from midfield.\n\nAnd Oregon capitalized on the kickoff when kicker Andrew Boyle booted the ball directly at Ohio State safety Caleb Downs, and the Ducks recovered off the ricochet.\n\n“We worked hard this week returning the ball after a penalty on the 50-yard line,” Day said. “We knew they were going to do something like that. That was well-designed by them, but that one hurt.”\n\nThe home team looked to be on its way to a score inside the Buckeyes’ 10-yard line, but Ducks wide receiver Traeshon Holden inexplicably spat on Buckeyes cornerback Davison Igbinosun, resulting in a 15-yard penalty and Holden’s ejection. Oregon settled for a Sappington 27-yard field goal, which gave the Ducks a 15-14 lead.\n\nOhio State pulled ahead 21-15 with 3:53 left in the half when Howard found wide receiver Emeka Egbuka wide-open for a 15-yard touchdown, but its lead didn’t last long.\n\nThree minutes later, Burke got beat again — this time by Ducks wide receiver Tez Johnson — and Gabriel uncorked a 48-yard bomb for a touchdown, giving Oregon a 22-21 lead at the half.\n\nOregon punted on its first drive out of the half, and the Buckeye offense used a six-play, 79-yard drive with a touchdown catch by wide receiver Jeremiah Smith to regain a 28-22 lead.\n\nThe Ducks drove down the field and went for it on fourth-and-goal 2 yards out but watched helplessly as the ball bounced off Buckeye Cody Simon’s back and fell to the turf.\n\nFollowing a Buckeyes punt, Gabriel faked out nearly the entire Ohio State defense en route to a 27-yard rushing touchdown, giving the Ducks a 29-28 lead with 13:20 left, but Ohio State grabbed the lead back with a 40-yard field and six minutes remaining.\n\nDown to the 1-yard line and fourth-and-goal, Sappington put through a 19-yard chip shot to put Oregon up 32-31 with 1:47 left.\n\nOhio State looked to be on its way to a come-from-behind victory, driving with just over 90 seconds remaining, but its drive was stalled by an offensive pass interference call on Smith, followed by two incomplete passes and Howard’s game-ending slide.\n\n“This one’s gonna hurt, does hurt, should’ve won the game,” Day said. “Give Oregon credit. They played well but [there were] too many things we could’ve done better in this game that we didn’t. Got a lot of football ahead of us, and we gotta get those things fixed.”\n\nAfter taking a bye week, the Buckeyes will host the Nebraska Cornhuskers Oct. 26, with an official time still to be announced.",

      "content": "Ohio State vs Oregon score today: Highlights from Buckeyes' heartbreaking Week 7 loss to the Ducks\nEHSAN KASSIM   USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThis story was updated with new information.\n\nOhio State football came up short when facing its toughest challenge of the 2024 college football season on Saturday.\n\nThe No. 2 Buckeyes (5-1, 2-1 Big Ten) fell just short in a 32-31 loss to No. 3 Oregon (6-0, 3-0 Big Ten) in Eugene, Oregon for a top-three matchup that could have significant ramifications in the conference standings and for the 12-team College Football Playoffs.\n\nOSU quarterback Will Howard saw the clock expire as he scrambled for a 12-yard run, attempting to get his team into position for a game-winning field goal. Oregon's Atticus Sappington hit on a 19-yard field goal with 1:47 remaining to give the Ducks the lead. There were seven total lead changes in the game, as both teams went back-and-forth all game.\n\nWatch OSU football vs Oregon live with Fubo (free trial)\n\nDespite the close final score, the game never featured any ties due to Oregon botching a snap following its first touchdown. The Ducks never led by more than one point, while the Buckeyes held a seven-point lead and two leads of six points.\n\nThis was the first Big Ten matchup between the programs, with Oregon joining the conference this season. Oregon has won back-to-back games over OSU, but the Buckeyes still hold the series advantage 9-2. In the team's most previous matchup, the Ducks won 35-28 on Sept. 11, 2021.\n\nCatch up here with scores, updates and highlights of Saturday's Big Ten game between Ohio State and Oregon:\n\nOhio State football vs Oregon score\nTEAMS\t1Q\t2Q\t3Q\t4Q\tF\nOhio State\t7\t14\t7\t3\t31\nOregon\t6\t16\t0\t10\t32\nOhio State vs Oregon live updates\n\nAll times Eastern.\n\nFinal: Oregon 32, Ohio State 31\nOSU-Oregon final stats\n\nHere's a look at the quarterback comparison for the game:\n\nWill Howard: 28 of 35 passing, 326 yards, two touchdowns\nDillon Gabriel: 23 of 34 passing, 341 yards, two touchdowns\n\nSome stats of note:\n\nTotal yards: OSU 467, UO 496\nRushing yards: OSU 122, UO 73\nPassing yards: OSU 326, UO 341\nFirst downs: OSU 22, UO 18\nTime of possession: OSU 33:09, UO 26:51\nPenalties: OSU 8-70, UO 3-25\nTurnovers (points off turnovers): OSU 1 (6), UO 0 (0)\nOhio State falls to Oregon on the road\n\n10:59 p.m.: Will Howard's scramble for 12 yards expires the remaining six seconds off the clock, and Oregon pulls off the 32-31 victory in Eugene. Following the win, the Ducks' fans storm the fans. Jeremiah Smith's offensive pass interference turns out to be a big swing in the game, as it pushed the Buckeyes out of field goal range.\n\nOregon takes 32-31 lead late over Ohio State\n\n10:47 p.m.: Atticus Sappington hits a 19-yard field goal to give Oregon a 32-31 lead with 1:47 remaining in the game. Will Howard and Ohio State will have one more chance to win the game. The Buckeyes only need a field goal to win.\n\n10:43 p.m.: Oregon has second-and-goal from the Ohio State five at the two-minute warning. The Ducks are looking to take the lead in the final moments but potentially leaving time on the clock for a comeback for OSU if Oregon indeed takes the lead.\n\nJayden Fielding gives OSU lead on field goal\n\n10:33 p.m.: Jayden Fielding gives Ohio State a 31-29 lead with 6 minutes remaining on a 40-yard field goal. OSU’s scoring drive is 13 plays for 53 yards and took 7:20 off the clock.\n\n10:18 p.m.: Dillon Gabriel scores on a 27-yard keeper to give Oregon a lead following the extra point. The Ducks lead 29-28 with 13:20 remaining. The scoring drive for Oregon goes five plays for 60 yards and takes 1:51 off the game clock. Should be a fun finish in Eugene.\n\nEnd of third quarter: Ohio State 28, Oregon 22\n\n10:12 p.m.: Ohio State retakes the lead in the third quarter and will enter the final quarter up 28-22. Oregon will start the fourth quarter with the ball near midfield.\n\n10:11 p.m.: A botched snap forces Ohio State to punt the ball away after gaining one first down.\n\n10:05 p.m.: Oregon turns the ball over on downs from the OSU 2-yard line. The Buckeyes take over there, nursing a six-point lead late in the third quarter. Questionable decision to not cut the lead to three points.\n\nJeremiah Smith, OSU recapture lead over Oregon\n\n9:50 p.m.: Jeremiah Smith hauls in a 6-yard touchdown pass from Will Howard and OSU has retaken the lead. The Buckeyes kick the extra point rather than going for the 2-point conversion and extending the lead to seven. The scoring drive for OSU goes six plays for 79 yards and takes off 3:08 off the clock.\n\nSmith has scored at least one touchdown in all six games of his freshman year.\n\n9:43 p.m.:  Oregon gets one first down on the second half's opening drive but is forced to punt on a fourth-and-8 from its own 44. OSU takes over on its own 21 after the punt.\n\n9:40 p.m.: Oregon begins the second half with the ball following a touchback.\n\nHalftime: Oregon 22, Ohio State 21\nOSU-Oregon halftime stats\n\nHere's a look at the quarterback comparison at halftime: \n\nWill Howard: 13 of 16 passing, 129 yards, one touchdown\nDillon Gabriel: 11 of 16 passing, 212 yards, two touchdowns\n\nGame Comparison\n\nOSU \tOregon \nTotal Yds\t251\t285\nPass Yds\t129\t212\nRush Yds\t122\t73\nPenalties\t4-30\t2-20\n1st Downs\t12\t8\n3rd Downs\t1-6\t2-6\n4th Downs\t2-2\t0-0\nTotal Plays\t37\t31\nAvg Yds/Play\t6.8\t9.2\nAvg Yds/Completion\t9.9\t19.3\nAvg Yds/Rush\t5.8\t4.9\nSack-Adj Rush Yd(Avg)\t122 (5.8)\t73 (4.9)\nRed Zone\t3-3\t3-3\nTime of Poss\t17:28\t12:32\nTurnovers (Def Pts Off)\t1 (6)\t0 (0)\nFumbles-Lost\t1-1\t0-0\nSacks (Def Yds)\t0 (0)\t0 (0)\nTFL (Def Yds)\t2 (3)\t2 (3)\n\n9:17 p.m.: Oregon football carries a 22-21 lead into halftime in a back-and-forth game between the two teams. The Buckeyes struck first, but the Ducks have fought back every time OSU scores, and vice versa.\n\n9:09 p.m.: Dillon Gabriel hits Tez Johnson for a 48-yard touchdown pass and Oregon has retaken a lead with 1:01 left in the first half. The Ducks' scoring drive was seven plays for 75 yards, and took 2:36 off the clock.\n\nIt was just the second catch of the game for Johnson. He beat Denzel Burke on the play.\n\nEmeka Egbuka gives OSU lead over Oregon\n\n9 p.m.: Emeka Egbuka scores on a 15-yard touchdown pass from Will Howard and OSU retakes the lead. The OSU scoring drive goes 12 plays for 75 yards and takes 6:16 off the clock.\n\n8:43 p.m.: Oregon has its first lead of the game on a 27-yard field goal by Atticus Sappington. The onside kick recovery and a big catch by Traeshon Holden set up the field goal. However, Holden was called for an unsportsmanlike penalty for spitting and was ejected. The 15-yard penalty hurt the Ducks chance of scoring a touchdown.\n\nOregon WR Traeshon Holden ejected\n\n8:42 p.m.: Oregon receiver Traeshon Holden was ejected for spitting on an Ohio State defender following a play. It also cost the Ducks' 15 yards on the penalty.\n\nAccording to the NCAA rulebook, \"Spitting on an opponent requires ejection.\" Ejections are different than disqualifications. A disqualified player can remain on the sideline. An ejected player must leave the field. \n\nOregon recovers onside kick\n\n8:37 p.m.: Oregon’s kicker kicked the ball off an Ohio State player, CJ Hicks, on a potential squib attempt. The Ducks recover and have the ball at the OSU 41. Oregon's Roger Saleapaga recovered the fumble.\n\nEvan Stewart, Dillon Gabriel score touchdown for Oregon\n\n8:33 p.m.: A pair of explosive plays by Dillon Gabriel and Evan Steward have the Ducks back within a possession. Gabriel hit Stewart for a 69-yard pass to set up first and goal. Gabriel hit Stewart for a 10-yard touchdown one play later. Oregon could not convert a 2-point conversion to tie the game.\n\nQuinshon Judkins scores to extend OSU lead over Oregon\n\n8:25 p.m.: Quinshon Judkins scores on a 1-yard touchdown to extend the Ohio State lead to 14-6. Will Howard gain 3 yards on the prior play to set up the touchdown. The drive goes four plays for 74 yards following the missed field goal by Oregon\n\nEnd of first quarter: Ohio State 7, Oregon 6\n\n8:21 p.m.: Ohio State leads 7-6 after the first quarter but is driving to take the lead when the second quarter starts potentially. Running back TreVeyon Henderson broke out for a 53-yard rush and then gained 17 on the next play. OSU has the ball facing first-and-goal from the Oregon 4-yard line.\n\n8:17 p.m.: Atticus Sappington misses a would-be 44-yard field goal to give Oregon a lead. The kick goes wide right.\n\n8:12 p.m.: Three offensive penalties help force a three-and-out for the OSU offense. Oregon begins at OSU's 41-yard line.\n\n8:02 p.m. Following the OSU fumble, Oregon scores two plays later. Jordan James had a 25-yard run, followed by a 3-yard touchdown run to cut the lead to 7-6. The snap on the extra point was bobbled and a throw was intercepted in the end zone.\n\n8:01 p.m.: The fumble call was confirmed and Oregon starts on the OSU 28-yard line.\n\n7:58 p.m.: Quinshon Judkins fumbles at the Ohio State 28-yard line, and Derrick Harmon recovers the ball for the Ducks. Oregon will have a short field trying to tie the game.\n\nThe play is now under review.\n\n7:54 p.m.: Oregon gains one first down on its opening drive but punts on a fourth-and-3 from its own 43. OSU will start on its own 15-yard line for its second drive.\n\n7:51 p.m.: Rule analyst Terry McAulay said he would have called the dual catch by Kacmarek an interception by Oregon, as Kacmarek never seemed to have full possession of the ball.\n\nWill Howard leads OSU to opening scoring drive vs Oregon\n\n7:43 p.m.: A Will Howard 1-yard touchdown rush gives the Buckeyes the opening score of the top-three matchup in Eugene. Howard and OSU completed a fourth-and-1 from its own 41 to keep the drive alive. Howard also completed a 32-yard pass to Will Kacmarek on the drive. The catch by Kacmarek could not be challenged on the field because the Buckeyes rushed to the line to get the next playoff. Kacmarek appeared to have dual possession of the ball with the Oregon defender.\n\nThe OSU drive lasted 10 plays for 75 yards and took five minutes off the clock.\n\n7:35 p.m.: Oregon wins the coin toss and defers to the second half; Ohio State will receive first, with the Ducks defending the west end-zone.\n\nPregame\n\n7:21 p.m.: Who are the officials for the Ohio State-Oregon game:\n\nReferee: Larry Smith\nUmpire: Matthew Richards\nHead Linesman: William McCoy\nLine Judge: Nicholas Bright\nBack Judge: Kevin Schwartzel\nField Judge: Timothy Maguire\nSide Judge: Monte Tilgner\nCenter Judge: Jason Gant\nOregon star EDGE Jordan Burch\n\n7:18 p.m.: Oregon star edge rusher Jordan Burch is out for today's game against Ohio State.

Burch is the Ducks' sack leader.\n\nGeno Smith watching cousin, OSU receiver Jeremiah Smith\n\n7:05 p.m.: Seattle Seahawk quarterback Geno Smith is in attendance to watch his cousin and OSU receiver Jeremiah Smith for today's game.

It’s been a decade since they last went to the West Coast during the regular season. Nonetheless, Ohio State has been near flawless in the early weeks, reviving its ground game and remaining stout on defense. The 34 points they have allowed over a span of five games are the fewest in the Bowl Subdivision in 2024. Oregon has far more skill position talent than the Buckeyes have faced in the Big Ten thus far, but the defensive line, the strength of their defense, has an edge against an offensive line that has been more inconsistent than a year ago, giving Ohio State an edge in a heavyweight tilt that will be decided in the trenches.\"\n\nChris Hansen, Eugene Register-Guard: Ohio State 35, Oregon 27\n\n\"The Ducks' defense has allowed just one touchdown and 16 points total in the past 10 quarters, but they haven't faced anything close to what the Buckeyes are bringing to Eugene this weekend. Oregon will have to play mistake-free football to slow down Ohio State's attack. That goes for the offense as well. Quarterback Dillon Gabriel, who has thrown three interceptions in the red zone the past two games, can't give away scoring opportunities this week. Lucky for the Ducks, they're playing in Autzen Stadium, where they are 34-1 since 2018. Expect an entertaining game in a raucous environment with the Buckeyes scoring last as they avenge the loss to Oregon in Columbus in 2021.\"\n\nWill Helms, College Football Network: Oregon 30, Ohio State 28\n\n\"These are two playoff teams who could meet again on a neutral field, but given Oregon’s home-field advantage, take the Ducks. Jordan Burch and the defensive line will make Howard uncomfortable enough to rush him. If the Ducks get a couple of turnovers, they’ll grind it out over an Ohio State team that isn’t used to playing for four quarters. Great game. Give me the Ducks straight up in a preview of a potential postseason rematch. I think the back-and-forth nature pushes it over as well.\"\n\nOhio State vs Oregon betting odds\n\nGame lines and odds from BetMGM as of Thursday, Oct. 10\n\nSpread: Ohio State (-3.5)\nOver/under: 53.5\nMoneyline: Ohio State -155, Oregon +130\nOhio State vs Oregon injury updates\n\nThis section will be updated.\n\nOhio State football 2024 schedule\n\nHere's a look at Ohio State's 2024 football schedule, along with kickoff times and television information:\n\nAll times Eastern.\n\nSaturday, Aug. 31: Ohio State vs. Akron (W, 52-6)\nSaturday, Sept. 7: Ohio State vs. Western Michigan (W, 56-0)\nSaturday, Sept. 14: BYE\nSaturday, Sept. 21: Ohio State vs. Marshall (W, 49-14)\nSaturday, Sept. 28: Ohio State at Michigan State* (W, 38-7)\nSaturday, Oct. 5: Ohio State vs. Iowa (W, 35-7)\nSaturday, Oct. 12: Ohio State vs. No. 3 Oregon* | 7:30 p.m. | NBC, Peacock, Fubo\nSaturday, Oct. 19: BYE\nSaturday, Oct. 26: Ohio State vs. Nebraska*\nSaturday, Nov. 2: Ohio State at No. 4 Penn State*\nSaturday, Nov. 9: Ohio State vs. Purdue*\nSaturday, Nov. 16: Ohio State at Northwestern*\nSaturday, Nov. 23: Ohio State vs. No. 20 Indiana*\nSaturday, Nov. 30: Ohio State vs. No. 21 Michigan*\nRecord: 5-0, 2-0 Big Ten\n\n*Denotes Big Ten game\n\nOregon football 2024 schedule\n\nHere's a look at Oregon's 2024 football schedule, along with kickoff times and television information:\n\nAll times Eastern.\n\nSaturday, Aug. 31: Oregon vs. Idaho (W, 24-14)\nSaturday, Sept. 7: Oregon vs. Boise State (W, 37-34)\nSaturday, Sept. 14: Oregon at Oregon State (W, 49-14)\nSaturday, Sept. 21: BYE\nSaturday, Sept. 28: Oregon at UCLA* (W, 34-13)\nFriday, Oct. 4: Oregon vs. Michigan State* (W, 31-10)\nSaturday, Oct. 12: Oregon vs. No. 2 Ohio State* | 7:30 p.m. | NBC, Peacock, Fubo\nFriday, Oct. 18: Oregon at Purdue* | 8 p.m. | FOX (Fubo)\nSaturday, Oct. 26: Oregon vs. No. 23 Illinois*\nSaturday, Nov. 2: Oregon at No. 21 Michigan*\nSaturday, Nov. 9: Oregon vs. Maryland*\nSaturday, Nov. 16: Oregon at Wisconsin*\nSaturday, Nov. 23: BYE\nSaturday, Nov. 30: Oregon vs. Washington*\nRecord: 5-0, 2-0 Big Ten\n\n*Denotes Big Ten game\n\nOhio State football news\nChip Kelly eager to return to Oregon, where he was the head coach from 2009-12\nThree keys for Ohio State to beat top-3 opponent Oregon\nCarnell Tate on track to return from injury\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

      "content": "Oregon Ducks' Dan Lanning Celebrates Ohio State Win: 'This Is Why You Come To Oregon'\nIn what was one of the biggest games in Oregon football history, the Oregon Ducks defeated Ohio State 32-31. Oregon not only proved they could compete with the best teams in the country -- they proved they can beat anyone in the country. Coach Dan Lanning reacts.\nKyron Samuels | 8 Hours Ago\nOregon Ducks head coach Dan Lanning celebrates after defeating Ohio State as the No. 3 Oregon Ducks host the No. 2 Ohio State Buckeyes Saturday, Oct. 12, 2024 at Autzen Stadium in Eugene, Ore. / Ben Lonergan/The Register-Guard / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images\nIn this story:\nOregon Ducks\nOhio State Buckeyes\n\nThe stage doesn’t get much bigger in college football for No. 3 Oregon Ducks vs. No. 2 Ohio State Buckeyes. It was the first-ever meeting between two top-five AP teams in Autzen Stadium, and there were 60,129 fans in attendance. The most ever in Autzen Stadium history. \n\nIn an incredible game that went down to the very last play, the Oregon Ducks came away with one of the biggest wins in program history with a 32-31 victory over the Ohio State Buckeyes.\n\n“So proud of our players, I’m so proud of our crowd. Talk about big moments, big games; this is why you come to Oregon,\" said Oregon coach Dan Lanning.\n\nThat was the message from coach Dan Lanning as he was surrounded by tens of thousands of rabid Ducks fans who stormed the field. Lanning was so overwhelmed and overcome with emotion that he could barely muster the breath to speak. It was that kind of night in Eugene. \n\nOct 12, 2024; Eugene, Oregon, USA; Oregon Ducks head coach Dan Lanning watches during the first half of the NCAA football game against the Ohio State Buckeyes at Autzen Stadium / Adam Cairns/Columbus Dispatch / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images\n\nIt was everything you’d hope a matchup of this caliber would be from start to finish. The future NFL players played up to that billing. The coaching matchups didn’t disappoint as both staffs out-schemed each other at times. Both teams lost key players, which affected the outcome. It was a damn good game wire-to-wire. \n\nBeyond statistics and results, the biggest takeaway should be that Oregon belongs on this stage under coach Dan Lanning. This has been the trend since Lanning took over the job. The Ducks have been in a conference title game and won New Year’s six bowls, but this was arguably the biggest stage they’ve been on since the 2011 national championship game.\n\nIt wasn’t perfect by any means. Oregon had its fair share of miscues in all three phases as well as coaching. So did Ohio State. So did Alabama and Georgia when they played in that blockbuster a couple of weeks ago. Mistakes happen, but more often than not, you can tell when a team belongs.\n\nOregon Ducks inside linebacker Dylan Williams leaps into the crowd as the No. 3 Oregon Ducks host the No. 2 Ohio State Buckeyes Saturday, Oct. 12, 2024 at Autzen Stadium in Eugene, Ore. / Ben Lonergan/The Register-Guard / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images\n\nOhio State has what some pundits consider to be the most talented team since the 2021 Georgia Bulldogs. That might be the case. The Buckeyes will surely have double-digit NFL draftees. Wide receiver Jeremiah Smith and safety Caleb Downs are arguably the best players in the country, and they’re not even draft-eligible. \n\nWith all that, Oregon never looked like they didn’t belong. They fought for sixty minutes and went toe to toe with what most people thought would be an Ohio State team that would overwhelm them. Little ole Oregon is no longer. They’re no longer the team that can’t handle physicality. They’re no longer the team that’s all speed and no power. They’re no longer the team that fails to rise on big stages.\n\nThey’ve announced their arrival to the college football world as a serious national championship contender. They’re now a top-two team in the nation and the conference leader in the clubhouse in their first year as a Big Ten program. They did it the hard way and earned the respect they deserved. \n\nYou can over-analyze the game film and crunch the numbers tomorrow. Tonight, the Ducks are winners, and now the whole world knows it. \n\nMORE: Oregon Ducks Vs.

It lived up to the hype, as the day featured outstanding games at the top of the sport's hierarchy and, for me, a new No. 1-ranked team.\n\nThe Ohio State-Oregon game featured six lead changes throughout, while four more games featuring top 25 teams needed overtime to decide a winner. \n\nAnd while there are still nine undefeated teams left in the sport at the halfway mark of the season, no one team feels unbeatable and no one team has separated itself with a resounding performance that has indicated success will be found in November, let alone the second half of October.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAll that's certain is the uncertainty that makes this sport the best in the world, and the second college football axiom holds true: Anything that can happen will happen. Just add water — or 2024 Vanderbilt.\n\nWith that, here is a look at my top 25 rankings following Week 7 of the college football season:\n\n1. Oregon (6-0)\n\nWeek 6 result: Defeated Ohio State, 32-31\n\nThe Ducks outlasted the Buckeyes at Autzen Stadium, marking their first win against a top-five opponent as a Big Ten member. The Ducks have won 35 of their last 36 games at Autzen and put up 32 points on a defense that had surrendered just 6.8 points per game prior to their first loss of the season.\n\nSportmode voor hem en haar tot -70% korting.

Texas (6-0)\n\nWeek 6 result: Defeated Oklahoma, 34-3\n\nOklahoma briefly looked like it might be poised for a fight with an early takeaway, but the Longhorns began overwhelming the Sooners with 21 points in the second quarter and 34 unanswered by game's end. Quinn Ewers returned from injury, throwing for 199 yards and a touchdown, while adding another score on the ground.\n\n3. Ohio State (5-1)\n\nWeek 6 result: Lost to Oregon, 32-31\n\nThe Buckeyes failed to do what most have when they visit Eugene … win. But Ohio State still looks like one of the best four teams in the sport and like a team that could still challenge for the Big Ten title.\n\n4. Penn State (6-0)\n\nWeek 6 result: Defeated USC, 33-30\n\nThe Nittany Lions fought back from a 14-point deficit to get their first road victory since August 31st and supplant themselves as one of just three unbeaten teams left in the Big Ten. \n\nTight end Tyler Warren enjoyed what might be a Mackey Award-winning performance with 17 catches for 224 yards with a touchdown in the win.\n\n5. Georgia (5-1)\n\nWeek 6 result: Defeated Mississippi State, 41-31\n\nThe Dawgs didn't cover the spread, which was 33.5 points, but they got the win to set up for a monster top-five showdown in the SEC next week. They'll travel to Austin, Texas, to play the undefeated Longhorns. Carson Beck threw for 459 yards in the win, but the Dawgs gave up 306 passing yards to Michael Van Buren Jr., which is worrisome as they prepare to play against a top-10 Texas offense.\n\n6. Miami (Fla.) (6-0)\n\nWeek 6 result: Idle\n\n7. Clemson (5-1)\n\nWeek 6 result: Defeated Wake Forest, 49-14\n\nSince scoring just three points against Georgia back in Week 1, Clemson has put up 40 or more in four of its five wins, and at least 29 points in all five. The Tigers have looked like the best team in the ACC since Week 2.\n\n8. Iowa State (6-0)\n\nWeek 6 result: Defeated West Virginia, 28-16\n\nMatt Campbell's team just keeps winning. Rocco Becht completed 18 of 26 passes for 265 yards and a touchdown, while Carson Hansen carried it 20 times for 96 yards and three scores. \n\nNo. 11 Iowa State Cyclones vs. West Virginia Mountaineers Highlights\n\n9. BYU (6-0)\n\nWeek 6 result: Defeated Arizona, 41-19\n\nThe Cougars forced four turnovers against the Wildcats to improve to 6-0 for the first time since 2020. With the victory, BYU stays atop the Big 12 standings in a tight race for first place. Cougars QB Jake Retzlaff threw for 218 yards with two touchdowns in the win.\n\nArizona Wildcats vs. No. 14 BYU Cougars Highlights\n\n10. LSU (5-1)\n\nWeek 6 result: Defeated Ole Miss, 29-26 (OT)\n\nGarrett Nussmeier found Kyren Lacy for a 25-yard touchdown on the first play from scrimmage in overtime to give the Bayou Bengals a walk-off win. Nussmeier finished with 337 passing yards, three TDs and two INTs in what could be a season-defining victory for the Tigers, who look to separate in a loaded SEC.\n\n11. Tennessee (5-1)\n\nWeek 6 result: Defeated Florida, 23-17\n\nFor the third straight game, the Tennessee passing attack has looked anemic. However, against a depleted and humbled Florida team, the Vols did enough to earn their second win in SEC play with a massive game against Alabama on tap next week.\n\nQuarterback Nico Iamaleava has not passed for more than 200 yards since the Vols' Week 2 win against N.C. State.\n\n12. Alabama (5-1)\n\nWeek 6 result: Defeated South Carolina, 27-25\n\nAlabama survived this game thanks to a missed field goal and a mismanaged final possession by the Gamecocks. For two and a half games, the Tide have not looked good — proving it with a loss to Vanderbilt — and now stumbling against a South Carolina team that will struggle to win eight games this season. One bright spot is that the Alabama defense did record four takeaways and four sacks against the Gamecocks.\n\n13. Notre Dame (5-1)\n\nWeek 6 result: Defeated Stanford, 49-7\n\nThe Fighting Irish scored 35 points in the second and third quarters and got their best performance to date out of QB Riley Leonard, who completed 16 of 22 passes for 229 yards and four total touchdowns. \n\n14. Texas A&M (5-1)\n\nWeek 6 result: Idle\n\n15. Missouri (5-1)\n\nWeek 6 result: Defeated UMass, 45-3\n\nWelcome back, Mizzou. Wideout Luther Burden accounted for 127 total yards, including a 61-yard rushing touchdown, on just seven touches against the Minutemen.\n\n16. Boise State (5-1)\n\nWeek 6 result: Defeated Hawaii, 28-7\n\nIt's the Ashton Jeanty show in Boise, and it was on display again Saturday. The do-it-all back rushed for 217 yards and a touchdown, while also adding another score through the air in the Broncos' win over Hawaii.\n\n17. Kansas State (5-1)\n\nWeek 6 result: Defeated Colorado, 31-28\n\nThe Wildcats escaped Boulder with a win, but it wasn't easy. Chris Klieman's team relied on the run game and halfback DJ Giddens, who carried the rock 25 times for 182 yards in the win.\n\n18. Illinois (5-1)\n\nWeek 6 result: Defeated Purdue, 50-49\n\nLuke Altmyer threw for 379 yards with three touchdowns in what became an instant classic in the Big Ten. A game that featured more than 1,000 yards of offense, including more than 600 through the air, came down to a two-point conversion attempt the Illini stopped to keep their Big Ten title hopes alive.\n\nPurdue Boilermakers vs. No. 23 Illinois Fighting Illini Highlights\n\n19. Indiana (6-0)\n\nWeek 6 result: Idle\n\n20. Pitt (6-0)\n\nWeek 6 result: Defeated Cal, 17-15\n\nWith the victory, Pitt improved to 6-0 for the first time since 1982 and has established itself as a legitimate challenger in the ACC title race. And the Panthers did it without much in the way of offensive yardage. They totaled just 277 yards — nearly 250 beneath their average in the first five games of the season.\n\n21. Ole Miss (5-2)\n\nWeek 6 result: Lost to LSU, 29-26 (OT)\n\nLane Kiffin's team put up 464 yards of offense, but the Rebels' defense couldn't slow down LSU's offense when it mattered most. Jaxson Dart passed for 284 yards and a score, but he only completed 24 of 42 passes in the game, likely putting an end to his Heisman chances, as well as the Rebels' SEC title chances.\n\n22. Arizona State (5-1)\n\nWeek 6 result: Defeated Utah, 27-19\n\nWhen you've gotta get hard yards, hand the ball to Cam Skattebo. That's what the Sun Devils did Friday night, as the senior running back rumbled for 158 yards and two touchdowns in an upset win over Utah. With the win, the Sun Devils hit the over on their preseason win total (4.5). \n\n\"For those of you who won,\" ASU coach Kenny Dillingham said, \"put the money back in the NIL collective.\"\n\n23. SMU (5-1)\n\nWeek 6 result: Idle\n\n24. Army (6-0)\n\nWeek 6 result: Defeated UAB, 44-10\n\nQuarterback Bryson Daily was responsible for five total touchdowns in a rout that started with a 20-point first quarter for the Black Knights. The win makes Army 6-0 for the first time in 28 years and extends the team's winning streak to 10 games, dating back to last season.\n\n25. Navy (5-0)\n\nWeek 6 result: Idle\n\nRJ Young is a national college football writer and analyst for FOX Sports and the host of the podcast \"The Number One College Football Show.\" Follow him at @RJ_Young and subscribe to \"The RJ Young Show\" on YouTube.\n\n[Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

      "content": "Ohio State vs. Oregon live stream, where to watch, TV channel, prediction, pick, spread, football game odds\nOhio State travels to Oregon for one of the most impactful games in the 2024 season\n By Will Backus \n12 hrs ago\n•\n4 min read\nUSATSI\n\nNo. 2 Ohio State travels to No. 3 Oregon on Saturday night for the first game between the Buckeyes and Ducks in Eugene since 1967 in what should be one of the most impactful games of the 2024 season. Not only does it count towards the final Big Ten standings -- a result of the latest major round of conference realignment -- it will have a huge bearing on the 12-team College Football Playoff race. \n\nNot only is this Ohio State's first trip to Eugene in almost 60 years, but this is just the fourth time this century that these two teams have faced off. The last time Oregon and Ohio State took the field against one another, the Ducks walked out of Columbus, Ohio, with a marquee 35-28 nonconference win 2021. \n\nThat was Oregon's first-ever victory over the Buckeyes, cutting Ohio State's advantage to 9-1 in the all-time series. Obviously, the stakes in this one are even higher. \n\nIt will be the third straight season that Big Ten teams ranked No. 2 and No. 3 have faced off. Each of the last two seasons it was No. 2 Ohio State and No. 3 Michigan, and the winner -- Michigan in both instances -- went on to earn a Big Ten title and spot in the College Football Playoff. \n\nFollow along with LIVE updates from Ohio State's trip to Oregon\n\nHow to watch Ohio State vs. Oregon live\n\nDate: Saturday, Oct. 12 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ET\nLocation: Autzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon\nTV: NBC | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)\n\nOhio State vs. Oregon: Need to know\n\nDillon Gabriel needs to play better: Most assumed that the transition from Bo Nix to Dillon Gabriel would, at the very least, be smooth. Gabriel is one of the most accomplished passers in college football, and he produced big results during stops at UCF and Oklahoma before landing in Eugene. The initial results have been underwhelming. \n\nGabriel's early season struggles were understandable. Oregon suffered through offensive line injuries through its first couple of games and it took a while for the run game to find its footing. Those issues tend to throw an offense out of rhythm. But in the Ducks' two Big Ten games, Gabriel has three interceptions. Two of those have come in the red zone, which is a glaring problem. His completion rate in conference play dropped to 68.4%, compared to 83.7% against nonconference foes, and his yards per attempt dropped to 7.1. He will have to elevate his game against a loaded Ohio State defense that features future NFL Draft picks at every level. \n\nOhio State and Oregon have been dominant: Ohio State currently leads the FBS in points per game differential (+39.2) this season, and the Buckeyes are also holding opponents to just 6.8 points per game. The Buckeyes won every contest by at least 28 and allowed the fewest points through five games since 1973.\n\nOregon has been equally impressive. Since the start of last season, Ohio State (+24.8) and the Ducks (+25.2) are the top two programs in terms of FBS point differential. Ohio State has also won 45 straight against conference opponents that aren't Michigan, while Oregon has won 18 straight games against conference foes that aren't Washington, including a 2-0 start to Big Ten play. This game likely won't be a blowout, but it is an interesting showcase of two of the most dominant teams (on a statistical basis, at least) over the past couple years. \n\nKeep an eye on Jeremiah Smith: Ohio State wide receiver Jeremiah Smith entered college football as one of the most ballyhooed freshman in recent memory and, somehow, he has exceeded expectations thus far. Through just five games, he is already second on the Ohio State true freshman receiving yards list. He passed Garrett Wilson and David Boston by reaching the 453-yard mark in last week's win against Iowa. He has also scored a touchdown in every game this year, which extends a freshman record that he already broke. \n\nHe currently leads all freshmen in receptions with 23 and he's tied for the FBS freshman lead in touchdowns with six. While the numbers are eye-popping, his actual play is even more remarkable. He makes one-handed grabs look routine, and snags anything thrown at him within a reasonable radius. There's going to be a lot of tremendous talent on the field Saturday, but it's going to be hard for viewers to take their eyes off Smith.\n\nOhio State vs. Oregon prediction, picks\n\nThis will be Ohio State's first real test of the season. It's the Buckeyes' first game against a ranked opponent, and Autzen Stadium is an extremely hard place to play. That being said, Ryan Day's squad matches up really well in this one. Oregon hasn't exactly set the world on fire so far, and its offensive struggles have been a big reason. The Ducks' offensive line allowed seven sacks in the first two games and, though they have buckled down since, Ohio State brings in the best defensive front they'll see all year. Oregon's run game has jelled recently, but Ohio State has held three of its five opponents below 100 total yards rushing. This game will be close; Ohio State should cover. Pick: Ohio State -3.5\n\n\n\nDennis Dodd\n\t\nTom Fornelli\n\t\nChip Patterson\n\t\nShehan Jeyarajah\n\t\nDavid Cobb\n\t\nJerry Palm\n\t\nBrandon Marcello\n\t\nRichard Johnson\n\n\nOSU -3.5\nOregon\n\t\nOhio State\n\t\nOhio State\n\t\nOhio State\n\t\nOhio State\n\t\nOregon\n\t\nOhio State\n\t\nOhio State\n\n\nSU\nOhio State\n\t\nOhio State\n\t\nOhio State\n\t\nOhio State\n\t\nOhio State\n\t\nOregon\n\t\nOhio State\n\t\nOhio State\n\nWhich college football picks can you make with confidence in Week 7? Visit SportsLine to see which teams will win and cover the spread -- all from a proven computer model that has returned over $2,000 in profit since its inception -- and find out.",

But while Saturday's contest is the first official Big Ten game between both programs, it isn't the first the Buckeyes and Ducks have faced off on the gridiron.\n\nIn fact, both programs have quite the history against each other over the years, including a College Football Playoff national championship game.\n\nREQUIRED READING: AD Ross Bjork: Ohio State spending over $2 million more on travel with Big Ten expansion\n\nHere's a look at the series history between Ohio State and Oregon:\n\nOhio State-Oregon series history\n\nAccording to Ohio State football's record books, Saturday's Big Ten matchup will be the 11th time both Ohio State and Oregon have played each other.\n\nIt will be the first time that both programs have played each other since a 2021 nonconference game at Ohio Stadium, when the 11th-ranked Ducks upset No. 3 Ohio State 35-28 in Columbus. Behind running back CJ Verdell's big day on the ground of 161 yards and three touchdowns, the Ducks handed the Buckeyes their first loss in the regular season under Urban Meyer since 2018.\n\nOhio State has traveled to Autzen Stadium and Oregon just once in the previous 10 meetings between both programs, coming in 1967, when the Buckeyes shut out the Ducks 30-0.\n\nOhio State record vs Oregon\nSeries record: Ohio State leads 9-1\nOhio State's last win: 2015 (42-20)\nOregon's last win: 2021 (35-28)\n\nThe Buckeyes are 9-1 in their previous 10 matchups against the Ducks, but lost the teams' most recent matchup in 2021. The first meeting between Ohio State and Oregon came in the 1958 Rose Bowl Game, a contest the Buckeyes won 10-7.\n\nOhio State and Oregon met up six different times between 1961 and 1987, all games the Buckeyes won to extend their streak to 7-0 vs. the Ducks. It took another 22 years for both programs to meet again, this time in the 2010 Rose Bowl Game. No. 8 Ohio State came out with 26-17 win vs. No. 7 Oregon, limiting the Ducks to just seven second-half points.\n\nThe two programs met in the 2015 College Football Playoff national championship game in a No. 1-vs.-No. 4 matchup at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Led by former Buckeye running back Ezekiel Elliott's big day of 246 rushing yards and four touchdowns, No. 4 Ohio State beat No. 1 Oregon and Marcus Mariota 42-20 for the first-ever CFP national title.\n\nOhio State vs Oregon games\n\nHere's a look at the results of past Ohio State-Oregon games, per Ohio State's record book:\n\nJan. 1, 1958: No. 2 Ohio State 10, Oregon 7\nNov. 18, 1961: No. 3 Ohio State 22, Oregon 12\nNov. 17, 1962: Ohio State 26, Oregon 7\nOct. 7, 1967: Ohio State 30, Oregon 0\nOct. 5, 1968: No. 6 Ohio State 21, Oregon 6\nSept. 10, 1983: No. 6 Ohio State 31, Oregon 6\nSept. 19, 1987: No. 4 Ohio State 24, Oregon 14\nJan. 1, 2010: No. 8 Ohio State 26, No. 7 Oregon 17\nJan. 12, 2015: No. 4 Ohio State 42, No. 1 Oregon 20\nSept. 12, 2021: No. 11 Oregon 35, No. 3 Ohio State 28\n \n ",

The Rebels surrendered a late game-tying drive that ended with a touchdown with 27 seconds remaining. After LSU held Lane Kiffin's Rebels to a field goal in overtime, Tigers quarterback Garrett Nussmeier threw a game-winning 25-yard touchdown catch on LSU's first play of OT.\n\nOle Miss (5-2, 1-2 SEC) struggled to create offense in the second half against LSU (5-1, 1-1 SEC)\n\nWatch Ole Miss football vs LSU live on Fubo (free trial)\n\nOle Miss vs LSU score updates\nLSU wins on first play of overtime\n\nGarrett Nussmeier connected with receiver Kevin Lacy down the right sideline for a game-winning 25-yard score.\n\nCaden Davis nails 57-yard field goal to keep Ole Miss' hopes alive\n\nThe Rebels needed a clutch kick and they got one. LSU wins with a touchdown.\n\nLane Kiffin's Rebels are in a hole early in overtime (OT)\n\nThe Rebels face a 3nd-and-25 from their own 40-yard line. The Rebels have been called for a holding penalty and a false start in this period\n\nOvertime: Ole Miss 23, LSU 23\nRebels quarterback Jaxson Dart sacked on potential game-winning Hail Mary (0:03, 4Q)\n\nThere just wasn't enough time for Ole Miss to respond. Ole Miss moved the ball 11 yards after LSU tied the game, but Ole Miss couldn't get a pass attempt off on the final play of regulation.\n\nOle Miss 23, LSU 23: Anderson 23-yard touchdown reception (0:27, 4Q)\n\nLSU ties the game on a clutch fourth-down pass with 0:27 remaining. LSU quarterback Garrett Nussmeier led the game-tying 75-yard drive. The Tigers converted two fourth downs.\n\nOle Miss 23, LSU 16: Davis 37-yard field goal (3:14, 4Q)\nFourth quarter\nOle Miss 20, LSU 16: Ramos 41-yard field goal (1:10, 3Q)\nOle Miss 20, LSU 13: Davis 35-yard field goal (4:41, 3Q)\nTigers miss field goal (7:17, 3Q)\n\nThe Tigers could not capitalize on a strip-sack fumble of Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart. LSU kicker Damian Ramos missed wide right from 46 yards out. The Rebels take over at their 28-yard line.\n\nThird quarter\nHalftime: Ole Miss 17, LSU 13\nOle Miss 17, LSU 13: Ramos 45-yard field goal (0:05, 2Q)\n\nLSU didn't gain a yard on its scoring drive, but the fortuitous fumble recovery was enough to set up Damian Ramos for a long field goal.\n\nHenry Parrish fumbles as Ole Miss looked to run out the clock (0:26, 2Q)\n\nThe Rebels took over deep in their own territory after LSU's touchdown. Running back Henry Parrish had the ball ripped free after catching a short pass from Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart. LSU recovers at Ole Miss' 28-yard line. It's a huge chance to tie the game going into halftime.\n\nTrey Amos rises up to pick off LSU's Garrett Nussmeier (10:57, 4Q)\n\nNussmeier lofted what was intended to be a deep 50/50 ball down the left sideline. Trey Amos' perfectly timed leap gave him the edge. Rebels take over at their own 39-yard line.\n\nOle Miss 17, LSU 10: Ramos 33-yard field goal (0:34, 2Q)\nOle Miss 17, LSU 7: Harris 15-yard touchdown catch (1:42, 2Q)\n\nThere was a highlight as the end of Ole Miss' 11-play, 75-yard scoring drive. Star receiver Tre Harris, who dropped a deep pass early in the first quarter, came up big with a contested touchdown catch on third down. The drive drained most of the time remaining in the first half and is a big response after LSU's first scoring drive.\n\nOle Miss 10, LSU 7: Green 12-yard touchdown catch (5:33, 2Q)\n\nLSU quarterback Garrett Nussmeier put together a nice drive to answer Ole Miss' good start. The Tigers went on a six-play, 75-yard drive.\n\nOle Miss 10, LSU 0: Bentley 50-yard touchdown run (8:39, 2Q)\n\nUlysses Bentley is back. The surprise third-string running back is balling out tonight. He took a 4th-and-1 run to the house to score the first touchdown of the season. Bentley has three carries for 60 yards, including a couple big first-down conversions. It was his first touchdown of the season.\n\nRebels stop LSU on 4th-and-2 (9:47 2Q)\nOle Miss 3, LSU 0: Davis 49-yard field goal (14:55, 2Q)\n\nOle Miss kicker Caden Davis responded after his short miss in the first quarter. On the first play of the second quarter, Davis came onto the field after a TV timeout and drilled a 49-yarder.\n\nSecond quarter\nRebels stopped on 4th-and-1 at LSU 5-yard line (4:45, 1Q)\n\nCoach Lane Kiffin went back to another direct snap. The gamble didn't pay off as running back Henry Parrish was stopped for no gain.\n\nCircus interception sets Ole Miss offense up in great position (6:00, 1Q)\n\nOle Miss defensive lineman Jamarious Brown made an incredible interception, but he got some help. After LSU quarterback Garrett Nussmeier's pass was tipped in the air at the LSU 12-yard line, Ole Miss linebacker Chris Paul deflected it again into Brown's arms. Paul was tied up with an LSU defender but popped the ball in a fortuitus direction like he was playing keep-it-up.\n\nOle Miss kicker Caden Davis misses short field goal (6:54, 1Q)\n\nThe Rebels' second drive ends with a whimper. A Jaxson Dart scramble was called back for a holding penalty. The Rebels had to settle for a 32-yard field goal attempt. Caden Davis missed wide right.\n\nJaxson Dart, Tre Harris almost connect for huge gain (13:40, 1Q)\n\nOle Miss' second offensive play may haunt the Rebels. With the ball at the Ole Miss 19-yard line, quarterback Jaxson Dart threw to star receiver Tre Harris on a deep route. Harris had to adjust slightly, but the pass was good. Harris bobbled it at the LSU 40 and dropped it, wiping away a potential touchdown. The Rebels punted two plays later\n\nOle Miss defense forces three-and-out to start the game (14:18, 1Q)\n\nThe Rebels defense issues the first statement of the game. Ole Miss forced two incompletions on tight sideline throws.\n\nFirst quarter\nJJ Pegues, Princely Umanmielen warming up for Ole Miss\n\nPegues and Umanmielen, both big parts of Ole Miss' defensive front, are listed as game-time decisions for the game against LSU.

With LSU’s season on the line, he hit Aaron Anderson for a 23-yard touchdown to force overtime.\n\nTigers fans sang their infamous NSFW anthem before overtime while the band provided the beat, and then Death Valley roared as loudly as it had all night just before the Rebels’ Caden Davis drilled a 57-yard field goal.\n\nOf course this zany game needed a 57-yard boot, right?\n\nAmid the din, Nussmeier kept his cool.\n\nGarrett Nussmeier delivers for LSU in crunch time\n\nStatistically, LSU's quarterback did not enjoy a banner night.

That's a 100 to nothin' ball,\" Nussmeier said.\n\nAnd who cares about the first 49 passes Nussmeier threw? Because his last two tosses were touchdowns.\n\n\"Nuss played a hell of a game,\" Lacy said.\n\nLacy joined Kelly in offering a more generous assessment of Nussmeier's night than the quarterback himself provided. Nussmeier called his performance one of the worst games of his career. He just kept firing away.\n\n\"That was a growth game for him,\" Kelly said.\n\nLacy’s 25-yard touchdown grab kept LSU’s playoff hopes afloat, while stomping on what was supposed to be a dream season for the Rebels, who fell to 5-2.\n\nTime for the tunes.\n\n“Grove St. Party” played on the stadium loudspeakers while Tigers fans stormed the field.\n\nA field-storming after a mild upset?\n\nAh, what the heck, after this wacky game, storm, Tigers, storm.\n\nBlake Toppmeyer is the USA TODAY Network's national college football columnist.

Tigers take over on their own 18-yard line.\n\n- Garrett Nussmeier and Co. march down the field to the Ole Miss 28-yard line after a 46-yard gain from Aaron Anderson, but come up with zero points on the possession after a missed 46-yard field goal attempt by Damian Ramos. Ole Miss takes over with 7:17 remaining in the frame.\n\n- Ole Miss signal-caller Jaxson Dart continues feeling the heat from the LSU front four, but the Rebels' offense treks down the field for a 35-yard field goal. 10-play, 54-yard drive. Dart went 3-for-6 with 40 yards through the air with the rushing attack adding 18 on the ground.\n\nScore Update: Ole Miss 20, LSU 13\n\n- LSU's offense has been limited through three quarters behind a rollercoaster performance from Garrett Nussmeier. He's 16-for-36 with 246 yards through the air while adding a touchdown. On LSU's second drive of the half, the Tigers reach Ole Miss territory, but a few missed throws for the Bayou Bengals to kick a field goal. Damian Ramos hits the 41-yard attempt.\n\nEnd of 3Q: Ole Miss 20, LSU 16\n\nFourth Quarter:\n\n- Ole Miss chews five minutes off the clock behind an 8-play, 40-yard drive, but the Tigers' defense doesn't break. Jaxson Dart lofts a 40-yard pass to the end-zone with LSU cornerback Zy Alexander coming up with the interception. Tigers take over on the 20-yard line with 11:02 remaining.\n\n- On the first play of the drive, LSU quarterback Garrett Nussmeier gives it right back to the Rebels after an interception. Louisiana native Trey Amos comes up with the pick. Rebels take over on the 39-yard line.\n\n- The LSU defense has been sensational tonight. It's been one of those days for Blake Baker's unit after forcing another three-and-out. Rebels punt it away. Tigers take over on the 15-yard line with 9:40 remaining.\n\n- After an LSU punt, Ole Miss takes it down the field to extend the lead to a touchdown game. Caden Davis drills the 37-yard field goal attempt with 3:14 remaining. 7-play, 54-yard drive.\n\nScore Update: Ole Miss 23, LSU 16\n\n- Garrett Nussmeier is doing all he can on the final drive of the game for the Tigers behind a 4th down conversion and a 3rd down conversion to keep the drive alive. He's completed a trio of passes for 43 yards with the Tigers inside the Ole Miss 35-yard line. 40 seconds remaining.\n\n- Garrett Nussmeier delivers a beautiful throw over the middle to Aaron Anderson for the game-tying touchdown. 13-play, 75-yard scoring drive that included a pair of 4th down conversions and a critical 3rd down conversion. 27 seconds remaining.\n\nScore Update: LSU 23, Ole Miss 23\n\nEnd of Regulation: LSU 23, Ole Miss 23\n\nOvertime:\n\n- LSU has won the coin toss and elects to play defense first. Ole Miss will start with the ball in the extra period.\n\n- The LSU defense forces Ole Miss to -15 yards on their drive in overtime. Caden Davis steps up and drills a 57-yard field goal to give the Rebels the lead.\n\nScore Update: Ole Miss 26, LSU 23\n\n- LSU quarterback Garrett Nussmeier connects with Kyren Lacy on the first play of the drive for a touchdown.

      "content": "LSU vs. Ole Miss live stream, where to watch, TV channel, prediction, pick, spread, football game odds\nOle Miss and LSU renew a rivalry that will play a key role in the SEC title race\n By Chip Patterson \n12 hrs ago\n•\n3 min read\nUSATSI\n\nA massive game in the SEC title race will take center stage in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, when No. 9 Ole Miss visits No. 13 LSU for a renewal of the a long-running rivalry that, since 2008, has included the Magnolia Bowl Trophy going to the winner. This will be the 113th meeting all-time between the two former SEC West foes, with the Tigers holding a 65-42-4 advantage in the series. \n\nThe matchup also features two of the SEC's most established coaches, as LSU coach Brian Kelly (190) and Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin (100) are the only active coaches in the conference with 100 career FBS wins. Kiffin has tallied 39 of those wins since arriving in Oxford, Mississippi and with a victory on Saturday he could become the fastest to 40 wins in Ole Miss program history. \n\nIn terms of the SEC title race, there is a bit for Ole Miss to steal a win in a hostile environment after losing at home two Kentucky on Sept. 28. The Rebels remaining schedule includes visits from Oklahoma and Georgia over the course of the next month, so taking a second conference loss this early in the SEC slate would create an uphill path to Atlanta. LSU, also, has some huge SEC matchups remaining on the schedule -- most notably Texas A&M (Oct. 26) and Alabama (Nov. 9) -- but have yet to take a conference loss and have won four straight since the season-opening defeat to USC. \n\nHow to watch LSU vs. Ole Miss live\n\nDate: Saturday, Oct. 12 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ET\nLocation: Tiger Stadium -- Baton Rouge, Louisiana\nTV: ABC | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)\n\nLSU vs. Ole Miss: Need to know\n\nTwo high-powered offenses: Last season's showdown was an offensive thriller, with Ole Miss topping LSU 55-49 in Oxford in a game that featured 1,343 combined yards of offense. And while Jayden Daniels and others are off to the NFL, early season results suggest that we could be in store for another back-and-forth battle between these two teams. Ole Miss still has star quarterback Jaxson Dart, top wide receiver Tre Harris. The Rebels currently rank No. 2 nationally in total offense (576.8 yards per game), No. 2 in passing offense (372.8 yards per game) and No. 2 in yards per play (8.11). And while LSU has turned the offense over to Garrett Nussmeier, the standard has been maintained with the junior quarterback currently ranked first in the SEC in passing touchdowns (15) and No. 5 nationally in passing yards per game (330.4).  \n\nOle Miss run defense has answered the challenge: Playing opposite a high-powered offense can stress a defense, but Ole Miss currently owns the nation's best point differential (+219) and yardage differential (+1,856). The Rebels' defense ranks No. 1 among all FBS teams in rushing defense (63.7 yards per game allowed), sacks (24), tackles for loss (63) and is tied with Texas allowing only three offensive touchdowns on the season. \n\nDon't underestimate Death Valley at night: LSU home games under the lights have long been considered one of the great environments and home field advantages in all of college football, and that's especially been the case since Brian Kelly's arrival. The Tigers are 12-0 in Saturday night games under Kelly, who also boasts a 16-1 record at home against all opponents in all kickoff times. But mystique spans multiple coaching regimes and multiple national title winners, as LSU is 108-15 in night games at Tiger Stadium since 2000.   \n\nLSU vs. Ole Miss prediction, picks\n\n\nThis game seems ripe to produce chaos and confusion, with a back-and-forth style that may come down to which team has the ball last. While Ole Miss has been the higher-performing team statistically, LSU should come out of the off week with a strong focus on what's needed to win and maintain an unbeaten start to SEC play. In this series the home team is 10-2 across the last 12 and covered the spread in nine of the last 10. We're projecting a continuation of that trend here.  Pick: LSU +3.5 \n\n\n\nDennis Dodd\n\t\nTom Fornelli\n\t\nChip Patterson\n\t\nShehan Jeyarajah\n\t\nDavid Cobb\n\t\nJerry Palm\n\t\nBrandon Marcello\n\t\nRichard Johnson\n\n\nLSU +3.5\nLSU\n\t\nLSU\n\t\nLSU\n\t\nLSU\n\t\nLSU\n\t\nLSU\n\t\nOle Miss\n\t\nLSU\n\n\nSU\nLSU\n\t\nLSU\n\t\nLSU\n\t\nLSU\n\t\nLSU\n\t\nLSU\n\t\nOle Miss\n\t\nLSU\n\nWhich college football picks can you make with confidence in Week 7? Visit SportsLine to see which teams will win and cover the spread -- all from a proven computer model that has returned over $2,000 in profit since its inception -- and find out.",

His last two snaps changed everything.\n\nNussmeier threw a tying touchdown pass to Aaron Anderson in the final seconds of regulation and hit Kyren Lacy for a 25-yard scoring strike on No. 13 LSU's first play of overtime, completing a stunning 29-26 comeback victory over No. 9 Mississippi on Saturday night.\n\n“Hopefully, this will be a huge growth moment for me in taking my game to the next level,\" Nussmeier said. “I played bad, but we had a chance to win the ball game and I had to focus on that.”\n\nThe winning score marked the first time LSU (5-1, 2-0 Southeastern Conference) led the entire game and fans streamed onto the field to celebrate a triumph that put the Tigers back in the College Football Playoff discussion.\n\n“This league's wide open and I think we took a huge step,” Nussmeier said. “The Tigers are real. We proved that tonight.\"\n\nNussmeier struggled much of the game and threw two interceptions, but came alive late to finish with 337 yards and three TDs passing. Two of those touchdowns came on the last two snaps he took.\n\n“There were struggles and there were mistakes but we found a way,” Nussmeier said. \"We have shown throughout the year that we have a tough team that really cares.”\n\nJaxson Dart passed for 284 yards and a score, and Ulysses Bently IV ran for a 50-yard touchdown on a fourth-down play for Mississippi (5-2, 1-2), which suffered a serious blow to its hopes for winning a conference crown or earning a CFP bid.\n\nOle Miss coach Lane Kiffin said his postgame message to the team was was: “This sucks guys. I feel for you.\"\n\n“I don’t really have a lot of positives for you,” Kiffin added. \"It’s easier if you get beat by a couple of scores. This was like, our game. We had the game and let it slip away. To go into the bye 6-1, or whatever it is, in really good shape and get healthy, would have been great. This one will be hard. It will be around forever.”\n\nOle Miss was one play away from winning in the waning minutes of regulation, but Nussmeier converted on fourth-and-6 with a pass to Mason Taylor to sustain a drive that he capped with a 23-yard TD pass to Anderson with 27 seconds left.\n\nAfter LSU held Mississippi to a field goal in its opening overtime possession, Nussmeier wasted no time unleashing a decisive strike to Lacy near the right pylon.\n\nLast season in Oxford, the Ole Miss offense gained 706 yards in a 55-49 victory over the Tigers. This year, LSU coach Brian Kelly wanted a more soundly played game by his defense and got it.\n\nLSU sacked Dart six times, intercepted him once, recovered a fumble and had a fourth-down stop at their own 5 while holding the Rebels well below their scoring average of 44 points coming in. Bradyn Swinson had two sacks, giving him seven this season.\n\n“We haven't said anything about last year, but we had that in the back of our mind as a defense,” said LSU linebacker Whit Weeks, who had a game-high 18 tackles, two for losses, including one sack. \"We knew we had to come out here and play way better.\"\n\nOle Miss was threatening to widen a 20-16 lead in the fourth quarter when LSU's Zy Alexander intercepted Dart's 35-yard pass in the end zone to help keep the Tigers close enough to rally.\n\nOle Miss controlled the opening quarter but squandered multiple scoring chances.\n\nTre Harris dropped a deep pass down the middle in open field. Davis missed a 32-yard field goal and Ole Miss could not cash in on defensive tackle Jamarious Brown's interception of Nussmeier's batted pass because the Rebels failed to convert on fourth down.\n\nThe Rebels still took a 10-0 lead on Davis' 49-yard field goal and Bentley's long, tackle-slipping run.\n\nThe Tigers responded with Nussmeier's 12-yard scoring pass over the middle to tight end Tray'Dez Green.\n\nHarris' 15-yard touchdown on a leaping, twisting catch in tight coverage made it 17-7. But LSU's Damian Ramos kicked two field goals in a 29-second span — the second after LSU's Whit Weeks caused Ole Miss' Henry Parrish Jr. to fumble — to make it 17-13 at halftime.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nMississippi: This was the second time the Rebels fell as favorites. The first came in a 20-17 loss to Kentucky.\n\nLSU: The Tigers proved they can play respectable defense against one of the better offenses in the nation, albeit with two weeks to prepare in this case after having a bye last week.\n\nUNDER SUSPICION\n\nThe Tiger Stadium crowd booed repeatedly when Ole Miss players went down with apparent injuries and received treatment from trainers — apparently unwilling to give the benefit of the doubt to a team under suspicion of feigning injuries to give players a breather at critical junctures.\n\nIn one instance, defensive end Jared Ivey went down after LSU had marched quickly from its own 25 to the Mississippi 18. Ivey was back on the field when LSU failed on third down and settled for a field goal.\n\n“That was something we knew was going to happen,” Nussmeier said. “We just talked about it and acknowledged it was a thing and just focused on not letting it affect us.”\n\nOn Friday, Mississippi issued a statement addressing the fact that its program had been highlighted in national discussions about faking injuries. Ole Miss said it would provide relevant medical information to national officiating coordinator Steve Shaw and that its coaching staff would speak with players to “ensure we conduct ourselves properly.”\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMississippi: Hosts Oklahoma on Oct. 26.\n\nLSU: At Arkansas on Saturday.\n\n------\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "content": "Gritty Tigers' improbable run ends in ALDS with Game 5 loss\nHinch: 'I have a heartbroken team for all the right reasons'\n2:55 AM GMT+2\n\nJason Beck\n\n@beckjason\nShare\n\n0:03\n\n1:55\n\nCLEVELAND -- The last time Tarik Skubal allowed multiple runs in a game, the Tigers were in Oakland on Sept. 6, still fighting to stay over .500. Skubal gave up two runs to the A’s in a wild extra-inning affair, and Detroit fell back to break-even.\n\nThe last time Skubal gave up a home run, Colorado’s Jordan Beck got him on a drive to left at Comerica Park on Sept. 12, the only run Skubal allowed in a loss that dropped Detroit 3 1/2 games back in the AL Wild Card race.\n\nThe last time Skubal allowed a run of any sort, Yuli Gurriel hit a first-inning RBI single off of him on Sept. 18 in Kansas City, a game that saw the Royals tax him for 95 pitches over five innings but Detroit still get a win to close the Wild Card gap a little more.\n\nAs Guardians outfielder Lane Thomas stepped to the plate with the bases loaded and one out in the fifth inning Saturday, Skubal had a 28-inning scoreless streak that had just ended and a 32-inning homerless streak still going. In a Tigers late-season run that has thrived on matchups, Detroit wouldn’t have wanted anyone else. They would’ve gladly taken it in early August, in mid-September and especially Saturday.\n\n“He could’ve given up 100 today, and I still would take him over anybody,” catcher Jake Rogers said.\n\nIt wasn’t just a snapshot of how dominant Skubal has been, but how far the Tigers came to get here. And as Thomas sent Skubal’s first-pitch fastball deep to left for a go-ahead grand slam, this was the matchup on which Game 5 of the AL Division Series turned, though it was far from the only reason the Tigers’ incredible postseason run ended in a 7-3 defeat.\n\nRelated\nHobbled Carpenter clutch again early, but can't convert late\n\n12:27 AM GMT+2\n\nTigers injuries and roster moves\n\nOctober 12th, 2024\n\nTigers' No. 9 prospect muscles up with 3-homer game in Fall League\n\n5:11 AM GMT+2\n\nTigers' ALCS hopes rest on fiery Skubal: 'He's built for the competition'\n\nOctober 12th, 2024\n\nWill the Tigers move on?

Hinch said. “I mean, we left everything we could on the field against a really good team, and we didn't want the season to end as abruptly as it did.\n\n“I thanked them for everything that they're about. I'm really proud to be the manager and represent them so many days in front of the camera, in front of the media, [and I] get to run the team on the field because of who they are and what they're about. And I let them know, there's only one team that doesn't have this pit in your stomach at the end of the year, and we were the next one to go through it.”\n\nIt was Detroit’s best against Cleveland’s best, which gave the Tigers some solace in an emotional clubhouse afterward.

It’s going to hurt for a little bit, but when it stops hurting -- maybe in a week, maybe a month, I don’t know -- super proud.”\n\nFor half an inning, Kerry Carpenter -- hobbled by a left hamstring he injured in Game 4 -- was poised to be the Tigers’ latest hero, stepping off the bench to lace a line drive off the right-field wall to score Trey Sweeney from first base and break a scoreless duel in the top of the fifth.\n\nCarpenter, whose three-run homer was all Detroit needed in Skubal’s previous start this series in Game 2, could only hobble to first base. But in a series that had seen the Tigers struggle to convert scoring opportunities since Game 4, he had done his job. It wasn’t much, but if anyone could carry it, Skubal was the guy, having held Cleveland to two singles over the first four innings and five hits over 11 scoreless innings for the series.\n\nThe Guardians pieced together a rally to set up the big swing. Andrés Giménez and Steven Kwan won lefty-lefty matchups, sitting on fastballs to slash opposite-field singles. David Fry’s infield grounder slowed as Skubal and Colt Keith gave chase, setting up a bases-loaded duel between Skubal and fellow All-Star José Ramírez.\n\n“We just talked about being on the heater,” Guardians manager Stephen Vogt said. “He's got two really good fastballs, and he threw them a lot to us over the last start, starting the regular season and all that. So we just talked to our guys about being on the fastball, and we were.”\n\nRamírez just missed a grand slam, sending Skubal’s 97 mph sinker down the right-field line but just foul. Skubal tried to bust Ramírez inside with his next pitch, but the 99.9 mph fastball hit Ramírez on the forearm, ending Skubal’s scoreless streak, tying the game and keeping the bases loaded for Thomas.\n\nThomas’ Statcast-projected 396-foot drive off Skubal’s 97 mph sinker was the first grand slam of Skubal’s professional career, Major or Minor Leagues. It was just Skubal's 18th Major League plate appearance with the bases loaded.\n\n“Lane was a pain in my butt this series,” Rogers said. “It was supposed to be sinker in, and it kind of leaked over the plate a little bit, and Lane did what he was supposed to.”\n\nThe five runs off Skubal tied his season high. He needed just nine pitches to retire his final five batters from there, exiting after six innings to hugs in the Tigers’ dugout.\n\n“Obviously, he gave everything that he could and more,” Hinch said. “And today wasn't his fault. I mean, he was in complete control of the game, and we wish we would have staked some runs for him to give him a little bit of breathing room, and it was a big blow.\n\n“This one is going to eat at him through the entire offseason because of what was at stake. But give me that guy again in a playoff series, in a playoff-deciding game.”\n\nDetroit had chances to answer the Guardians’ rally. But while they chipped away -- Spencer Torkelson doubling and scoring on Rogers’ two-out single in the sixth and Keith doubling home Greene in the seventh -- they couldn’t get the bigger inning they needed.\n\nWhile the Guardians celebrated on the field in front of a raucous sellout crowd, the Tigers soaked it in.\n\n“I watched it,” said Parker Meadows, who reached base safely four times off four pitchers and tied Hall of Famer Charlie Gehringer’s franchise record with hits in seven consecutive games to begin his postseason career. “It hurts, but it’s part of the game. We’re all going to look back and be happy with how far we came. We proved a lot of people wrong.”\n\nDid you like this story?\nIn this story:\nDetroit Tigers\nTarik Skubal\n\nSenior Reporter Jason Beck has covered the Tigers for MLB.com since 2002.",

      "content": "Detroit Tigers whiff on finding one final winning moment in ALDS loss to Cleveland\nJARED RAMSEY   Detroit Free Press\n\nCLEVELAND — As Detroit Tigers manager A.J. Hinch pointed out this week, every moment of playoff baseball is magnified because it can swing a series. And in the five-game sample from the Tigers and Cleveland Guardians in the ALDS, the Guardians found a way to come up with the final winning moment.\n\nCleveland emerged from the back-and-forth ALDS series by taking the decisive Game 5 on Saturday, 7-3. The Tigers jumped ahead early 1-0 in the top of the fifth inning, but the Guardians responded with five runs in the bottom, including a Lane Thomas grand slam off Tarik Skubal that ended up being the game-winning hit.\n\nOn that swing, the Guardians found their one extra thing to push them past the Tigers. The evenly matched series from the regular season — won by the Guardians, 7-6, despite being outscored by the Tigers — carried over into an intense five-game postseason showdown, with the more experienced team finding a way to gut it out.\n\n\"When you see how close the game is on so many levels and so many instances, you know, obviously they did just a little bit more,\" Hinch said. \"And so it doesn't surprise me given how we played these guys the entire season. But hats off to them for winning this series as opposed to anything else.\"\n\nRAINER SABIN: In ALDS Game 5 loss, Tarik Skubal and Detroit Tigers not indestructible after all\n\nThe five-run fifth snapped a 17-inning postseason scoreless streak from Skubal and, more importantly, put the Tigers in a hole that proved impossible to climb out of against Cleveland's arsenal of bullpen arms. Detroit scraped out a run apiece in the sixth and seventh innings, but the Guardians matched with two insurance runs, including another driven in by Thomas.\n\n\"You dream of moments like that on this stage and in this moment,” said Thomas, who finished 2-for-4 with five RBIs. \n\nThe Guardians' victories can be narrowed down to three key turning points — along with the complete effort from the pitching staff in neutralizing the Tigers' bats — Thomas clinched the series with the grand slam after David Fry won Game 4 with a late 2-run home run and Thomas blew the cap off a Game 1 blowout with a three-run first-inning homer.\n\n\"It was indicative of our matchups throughout the regular season, and it's kind of whoever got the big hit was going to win,\" Guardians manager Stephen Vogt told reporters. \"And fortunately Lane got it, and then we added on. They didn't go away.\"\n\nVogt's ecstasy stood in stark contrast to Hinch, who described himself as having a \"heartbroken team\" to address in the clubhouse, while agreeing that the series came down to just a few key moments.\n\n\"I wish I could sleep it off and then get to the next game,\" Hinch said. \"I mean, that's the goal. But this was an incredible series. It's great for baseball. It's great for the AL Central.\"\n\nThe Tigers put themselves in position for winning plays in two previous games but could not find the winning moments a third time. The Tigers finished the series 5-for-46 (.108) with runners in scoring position, including 1-for-12 in Game 5 — the only hit came from Jake Rogers in the sixth inning to cut the Guardians' lead to 5-2.\n\nOn Saturday, the Tigers had runners in scoring position in the first, second, fourth, sixth, seventh and eighth innings, but couldn't crack former teammate Matthew Boyd or the plethora of relievers that succeeded him.\n\n\"It was part of the story today,\" Hinch said. \"We had a lot of opportunities. If you look down, they only had opportunities in three or four innings. We had it in seven or eight. But they got the biggest swing in the biggest moment with the most at stake and separated themselves, and they were able to hang on with a beast of a bullpen that is tough to deal with.\"\n\nAILING SLUGGER: Adrenaline powered Kerry Carpenter's quick return to Tigers' lineup in ALDS Game 5 loss\n\nOne missed pitch\n\nSkubal cruised through the first four innings looking every bit of the AP pitching Triple Crown winner that dominated all season and in two playoff starts.\n\nBut he ran into trouble in the fifth and missed with one pitch in the biggest at-bat of the series; Thomas, meanwhile, didn't flinch at the middle-middle fastball and put it in the left field seats.\n\n\"It's just one pitch,\" Skubal said. \"It's just one pitch that I'd love to have back. ... It's just one pitch and credit to him, he didn't miss it. And what a swing. So that's where I was at. In the moment you're thinking about executing the pitch and I didn't do that.\"\n\nThe inning began with an Andrés Giménez single the other way, a strikeout and a Steven Kwan opposite-field single to put two on. Fry poked a grounder into the gap between Colt Keith and Spencer Torkelson for an infield single to load the bases for José Ramírez. Skubal hit Ramírez in the hand to plate one run before a mound visit and then Thomas' at-bat.\n\nThe first-pitch sinker to Thomas was supposed to be inside, but instead \"it kind of leaked over the plate a little bit,\" Rogers said. \"And Lane did what he was supposed to. They are a lot of good hitters.\"\n\nThe Tigers have not lost faith in their ace after his first loss since Sept. 12. Skubal himself said he felt \"crisp\" despite the sideways fifth, and Hinch said he's already waiting to put his name back on a lineup card.\n\n\"Today wasn't his fault,\" Hinch said. \"I mean, he was in complete control of the game, and wish we would have staked some runs for him to give him a little bit of breathing room, and it was a big blow. This one is going to eat at him through the entire offseason because of what was at stake. But give me that guy again in a playoff series, in a playoff-deciding game, and I look forward to putting his name in the starting lineup as a pitcher.\"\n\n\"That's the game, right?\" Skubal said. \"One swing, one pitch and that's what happens in these scenarios. That's what happens in the postseason, most games are won by the team that has the big swing which is usually a homer.\"\n\nJared Ramsey is a sports reporter for the Detroit Free Press covering the city's professional teams, the state's two flagship universities and more.

(AP Photo/Phil Long)\n\nCLEVELAND — For the third time in less than a month, the Cleveland Guardians made a semi-circle in the middle of their clubhouse and emptied champagne and beer bottles on each other as “Rocky Top” blasted through the speakers.\n\nThe choice of music is unique. So is this team.\n\nThe Guardians are an October surprise.\n\nLane Thomas hit a grand slam off Detroit ace Tarik Skubal and the Guardians, who have won with timely hitting and a shutdown bullpen all season, followed that script for a 7-3 victory over the Tigers in Game 5 of their AL Division Series on Saturday.\n\nNext up for Cleveland is the New York Yankees in an AL Championship Series between two teams that have crossed paths six previous times in the playoffs. They last met in 2022, with the Yankees taking their ALDS in five games.\n\nGame 1 is Monday in the Bronx.\n\nWith their $109 million payroll, the Guardians are an oddity among baseball’s final four — the little guys taking on the big-spending Yankees, Mets and Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nIt’s Cleveland against the world.\n\n“We’re playing a very, very good Yankees team,” said Guardians first-year manager Stephen Vogt. “We’ve seen them in the regular season. This is one of the most talented teams in the league. So we know we have our work cut out for us.”\n\nThomas had five RBIs for the Guardians, who weren’t expected to contend this season. But they won the tough AL Central under Vogt, giving the franchise a chance to stop a World Series title drought stretching to 1948.\n\n“We’re a step closer. Any time you’re a step closer, the more you want to win,” All-Star third baseman José Ramírez said through an interpreter. “And we want to win it for the city.”\n\nThe Guardians had to take down Skubal, the front-runner for the AL Cy Young Award, to keep it going. The left-hander had not given up a run in 28 consecutive innings — 17 in this postseason — before the Guardians tagged him in the fifth for five runs, tying the most he allowed in 2024.\n\n“They wanted to face him today,” Vogt said. “And if you don’t show up fully confident that you’re going to win, you don’t show up to the field. That’s been our approach all year, and we’re not going to stop now.”\n\nCleveland pieced together its big inning off Skubal with the team’s familiar, scrappy style dubbed “Guards Ball,” getting three singles — one an infield roller — to load the bases before Skubal hit Ramírez on the left hand to force in a run.\n\n“That’s who we are,” Vogt said. “That’s who that group has been in that room all year. As soon as we get punched, we answer. That’s been our M.O. all year long — as soon as we give up a run, our guys come right back.”\n\nThat brought up Thomas, who hit a three-run homer in Cleveland’s 7-0 win in Game 1.\n\nThe center fielder, who struggled in his first month with the Guardians after coming over in a July trade with Washington, connected on Skubal’s first pitch, sending it just over the 19-foot-high wall in left-center field.\n\nWhen the ball touched down, the Guardians’ dugout emptied and the screaming, red-clad Progressive Field crowd erupted in celebration.\n\nIt was another monster moment for Thomas, a Tennessee native and the reason why the club added “Rocky Top” to its postgame playlist.\n\n“Definitely had some struggles those first two weeks, or maybe even the month,” Thomas said, reflecting on his rocky start with Cleveland. “I’m just thankful they kind of hung with me and let me get my feet under me and kept giving me at-bats. It felt good to kind of come through late in September and obviously in the playoffs.”\n\nThe homer was a rare misstep in what has been a dominant season for Skubal.\n\n“It was one pitch,” Skubal said. “I would love to have it back. But what a swing. In the moment, you think about executing the pitch and I didn’t do it. This will sting a little bit and it should.”\n\nAs has been the case all season, Vogt leaned on his MLB-best bullpen, which showed some wear and tear.\n\nAfter Thomas hit his homer, the Tigers threatened in the sixth, scoring a run on a single by Jake Rogers and loading the bases with two outs. But Hunter Gaddis struck out Kerry Carpenter, who won Game 2 with a three-run homer in the ninth.\n\nThe Tigers, though, kept clawing and closed to 5-3 on Colt Keith’s one-out RBI double in the seventh. Eli Morgan came in for Cleveland and struck out both batters he faced.\n\nThomas hit an RBI single in the seventh to put the Guardians up by three, and Vogt turned to All-Star closer Emmanuel Clase, the AL’s saves leader, in the eighth to put the Tigers away.\n\nThrowing one 100 mph fastball after another, Clase got the final six outs. When he retired Keith on a routine grounder to first, the Guardians could finally exhale and plan for their first ALCS visit since 2016.\n\n“These moments are made for confidence,” Clase said through an interpreter. “I feel that I’m made for that.”\n\nSkubal lost for the first time since Aug. 2, and the Tigers, who missed a chance to eliminate the Guardians at Comerica Park on Thursday, had their unimaginable late-season push end in disappointment.\n\n“I have a heartbroken team for all the right reasons,” said Detroit manager A.J. Hinch, who pushed all the right buttons down the stretch. “I mean we left everything we could on the field against a really good team and we didn’t want the season to end as abruptly as it did.”\n\nOut of contention in August, Detroit regrouped and rerouted its season. Energized by some kids they brought up from the minors, the Tigers took off and went 31-13 after Aug. 11 to earn a postseason berth — one of three AL Central teams to make it.\n\nThey swept Houston in the wild-card round before meeting Cleveland in the postseason for the first time after more than 2,300 games between the franchises.\n\nThe Guardians took hold of first place in April and never let go. Cleveland became one of the season’s biggest surprises, winning 92 games under Vogt, a former journeyman catcher who had no previous managerial experience.\n\nBefore the game, Vogt was confident his team wasn’t done.\n\n“It feels like we’re going to New York,” said Vogt.\n\nThe Guardians are on their way.\n\nNEWSLETTER\nToday's breaking news and more in your inbox\nEmail(Required)\nI'm interested in (please check all that apply)(Required)\n Daily Newsletter\n Breaking News\n Obituaries\nAre you a paying subscriber to the newspaper?(Required)\n Yes\n No\nLATEST NEWS\nGuardians defeat Tigers 7-3 to advance to ALCS\nZelenskyy appeals to allies to keep up aid as Germany pledges new weapons package\n\nBERLIN (AP) — President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said today it's important that allies' aid to Ukraine doesn't ...\n\nResidents repair their homes and clean up after Hurricane Milton tore through Florida\n\nST.

There was no alternative.\n\nHe gave everything he had for the Tigers.\n\nPushing through on adrenaline, Carpenter delivered a pinch-hit RBI single in the fifth inning before the Cleveland Guardians stormed back to win Game 5 of their AL Division Series, 7-3 over the Tigers on Saturday.\n\n“These guys in the clubhouse are pretty much who I fight for,” Carpenter said. “If I could go, I wanted to go for them. That was the driving reason I wanted to be here for this team — if I could contribute.”\n\nWhile Carpenter came through once, he also struck out swinging with the bases loaded in a big spot as the Tigers’ memorable season — they went 35-16 after Aug. 10 — ended with a loss to their division rivals.\n\nDetroit’s first postseason appearance since 2013 was still special, and Carpenter was one of the biggest reasons.\n\nThe 27-year-old Carpenter, who missed three months with a back injury, hit a three-run homer in Game 2 off All-Star closer Emmanuel Clase as the Tigers evened the series with the Guardians.\n\nRELATED STORIES\nGuardians' bullpen blows away Tigers in ALDS opener.

Hinch said. “We were the next one to go through it. ... Seasons end fast, you know, when you’re in the middle of this sprint race through the playoffs and come up a little bit short.”\n\nAfter receiving round-the-clock treatment, Carpenter came off the bench and delivered for the Tigers again in Game 5.\n\nIn the fifth, he laced his single into right-center field off rookie Andrew Walters to score Trey Sweeney, who walked to open the inning.\n\nOn his way to first, Carpenter favored his leg, limping like Kirk Gibson did when he connected for his famous homer in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series for the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nThe Tigers were hoping Carpenter could help in the win-or-else series finale. After his single, he pumped his fists at his teammates celebrating in the dugout.\n\n“I know how uncomfortable it was for him,” Hinch said. “He came up really big with that spot and was able to squeeze three at-bats from him on a day where when I got to the ballpark, I didn’t know if he would do anything.\n\n“And so for that, our training staff did an incredible job. Carp gutted it out and was available for how I used him.”\n\nCarpenter got injured while running the bases in Game 4 on Thursday night.\n\nThe quick turnaround — and MLB’s decision to move the starting time up seven hours, citing a chance of inclement weather — didn’t give him much recovery time.\n\n“I knew he was able to do one of two things,” Hinch said. “If I got him in the DH spot, he could stay in the DH spot and go base to base, albeit uncomfortably. If I hit him in a different spot, then his day was over.\n\n“So the debate in my head going into the game was where is the big at-bat going to come where you either need to extend your lead, get a lead, come from behind or whatever.”\n\nThere was no score when Carpenter, who bats from the left side, replaced designated hitter Justyn-Henry Malloy, a right-handed hitter. Carpenter went to the plate again in the sixth with Detroit down 5-2, and he struck out swinging against Hunter Gaddis — leaving the bases loaded.\n\nHe also struck out swinging against Clase with a runner on second in the eighth.\n\n___\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB\n\n  \nby Taboola\nSuggested For You\nMassachusetts pharmacist gets up to 15 years in prison for meningitis outbreak deaths\n Nike tot -70% korting.

      "content": "Detroit Tigers encouraged with Kerry Carpenter's progress, but still game-time decision\nJARED RAMSEY   Detroit Free Press\nShow Caption\n\nCLEVELAND — The Detroit Tigers got an encouraging update Kerry Carpenter's availability for Game 5 of the ALDS against the Cleveland Guardians on Saturday, but did not confirm he's active.\n\nManager A.J. Hinch said Carpenter went through hitting drills after the team's workout on Friday and will go through a full workout pregame before determining his status as a game-time decision. Carpenter left Game 4 early on Thursday with a left hamstring injury suffered while running the bases.\n\n\"We'll make a decision right before game time,\" Hinch said. \"The encouraging part is he's doing something and moving around. He hit yesterday in the cage after our workout which was good and we are all hoping for the best. He just has another test that he's got to deal with before we can definitively say that he's good to go.\"\n\nAccording to MLB's transaction tracker, the Tigers did not make any moves on Saturday, meaning Carpenter will be available off the bench on Saturday and will not have to be replaced on the ALCS roster, should the Tigers advance.\n\nCarpenter was always going to be coming off the bench for Game 5, injury or not, due to the pitching matchup. The Guardians are starting left-handed pitcher Matthew Boyd so Hinch loaded his lineup with righties, including Justyn-Henry Malloy at DH.\n\nShortly before Hinch spoke to the media, Carpenter walked out of the visiting clubhouse with a bat in his hands. Hinch added that the Tigers' hitting coaches were pleased with his swing on Friday.\n\n\"I think he's sore and I think he's dealing with some discomfort and not feeling 100% but he's also feeling some adrenaline for Game 5 in the ALDS. So that's a good counter to not feeling at your best.\"\n\nHinch was encouraged about Carpenter's pending status when he first saw him on Saturday. Carpenter was on the early bus to Progressive Field and had a big smile on his face when he saw the manager.\n\nTHIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT: Stressful? You bet. But if Detroit Tigers say this ALDS Game 5 will be fun, have some.\n\n\"He was on the early bus and was in great spirits,\" Hinch said. \"So when I saw the big smile, I got more and more optimistic that we were going to get good news.\"\n\nThe Tigers are using nearly the same lineup as Game 2, with one small tweak. Left fielder Riley Greene moved up to the third spot in the batting order behind Malloy and Matt Vierling while second baseman Andy Ibáñez slid down to the fourth spot.\n\nJared Ramsey is a sports reporter for the Detroit Free Press covering the city's professional teams, the state's two flagship universities and more.

      "content": "Guardians vs. Tigers score, highlights | ALDS Game 5 recap; Guards advance to ALCS with win\nRYAN LEWIS ,  NATE ULRICH   Akron Beacon Journal\nShow Caption\n\nDETROIT — A winner-take-all Game 5 Saturday was a fitting end to a series featuring two teams that almost couldn't have played each other any closer in 2024.\n\nAnd the Cleveland Guardians snapped an eight-game losing streak in winner-take-all playoff games by beating the Detroit Tigers 7-3 Saturday. Cleveland wins the American League Division Series 3-2, as Lane Thomas' grand slam played a big part in Game 5.\n\nThe Guardians won the regular season series 7-6, though the Tigers won the run differential battle 60-50. The Guardians have won Games 1 and 4 of this ALDS, with the Tigers taking Games 2 and 3.  \n\nSaturday's matchup featured a rematch of Game 2 starters Matthew Boyd for Cleveland and Tarik Skubal for Detroit. \n\nHere's how Game 5 unfolded through our live score updates, highlights and analysis Saturday.\n\nGuardians beat the Tigers to advance to ALCS\n\nThe Guardians are heading to the ALCS. Emmanuel Clase recorded the final six outs in a 7-3 win.\n\nWhen do the Guardians and Yankees begin play in the ALCS?\n\nCleveland will face the New York Yankees in the best-of-seven ALCS, with the Yankees having home-field advantage. Game 1 is Monday night in New York.\n\nGuardians ALCS schedule vs Yankees: Guardians vs. Yankees in the ALCS starts Monday. Here's the full series schedule\n\nBrayan Rocchio adds to Guardians lead\n\nBryan Rocchio, who has had a tremendous ALDS, has given Cleveladn a 7-3 led with an RBI single in the eighth inning.\n\nEmmanuel Clase strikes out Kerry Carpenter, stares him down\n\nEmmanuel Clase struck out Kerry Carpenter swinging to end the eighth inning and then stared him down as he walked off the mound. That was a big strikeout for Clase after Carpenter took him deep for a winning three-run home run in Game 2.\n\nEmmanuel Clase coming in for six outs; Guardians-Tigers ALDS Game 5 update\n\nEli Morgan walked Parker Meadows to open the eighth inning, and the Guardians are turning to Emmanuel Clase to record the final six outs of the game.\n\nLane Thomas RBI single off Will Vest extends Guardians ALDS Game 5 lead\n\nThe Guardians have Tarik Skubal out of the game, and now they have a three-run lead.\n\nWith two runners on, Lane Thomas singled to the right side of the infield off of Will Vest to make it 6-3 in the seventh inning.\n\nAnd Emmanuel Clase is warming up.\n\nEli Morgan strikes out Spencer Torkelson\n\nThe Guardians are six outs away from the ALCS.\n\nEli Morgan struck out Spencer Torkelson looking to end the seventh, which is a massive out, as Cleveland is nearing Emmanuel Clase territory.\n\nColt Keith RBI double cuts Guardians lead to 2 runs\n\nThe Tigers continue to chip away.\n\nWith a runner on, Colt Keith drilled an RBI double to center field that has made it a 5-3 score.\n\nEli Morgan is coming in with one out in the seventh. The Tigers need to pounce now, in the seventh as Emmanuel Clase should be given four, five or even six outs.\n\nHunter Gaddis strikes out Kerry Carpenter with the bases loaded\n\nThe Guardians are nine out away.\n\nWith the bases loaded and two outs in the sixth, Hunter Gaddis struck out Kerry Carpenter swinging to end the inning in a massively important at-bat.\n\nCade Smith and Gaddis are also now the first teammates to pitch in every game of a five-game ALDS in postseason history.\n\nGuardians-Tigers Game 5 score: Detroit cuts into Cleveland lead in the sixth\n\nThe Tigers will have a lot of work to do, but they've chipped into the Guardians lead in the sixth inning.\n\nWith runners on the corners, Jake Rogers singled to right-center field to make it 5-2.\n\nTrey Sweeney drew a walk, which will set up a two-out, bases-loaded matchup between Hunter Gaddis and Kerry Carpenter.\n\nLane Thomas hits grand slam off Tarik Skubal\n\nLane Thomas just sent Progressive Field into a frenzy the likes of which hasn't been seen since Rajai Davis in Game 7 of the 2016 World Series.\n\nWith it tied 1-1 and the bases loaded, Thomas drilled a grand slam off of Skubal that just cleared the wall in left field. The home crowd went absolutely nuts, and Progressive Field was shaking as Thomas rounded the bases.\n\nThat's the first Cleveland postseason grand slam since Francisco Lindor in the 2017 ALDS.\n\nBefore that inning, Skubal had thrown 17 scoreless innings in the postseason.\n\nThe Guardians are 12 outs away from the ALCS with a four-run lead and the game's best bullpen.\n\nJose Ramirez hit by pitch to tie ALDS Game 5; Guardians-Tigers score\n\nThe Guardians have tied it, but it might have come at a cost.\n\nWith the bases loaded, Tarik Skubal hit Ramirez with a pitch in the left arm. Ramirez is in obvious pain but remaining in the game. The pitch was 99.9 mph.\n\nLane Thomas is up with a chance to give the Guardians their first lead of the day.\n\nGuardians load the bases for Jose Ramirez vs. Tarik Skubal\n\nThe matchup of the series is upcoming.\n\nAndres Gimenez and Steven Kwan both singled, and David Fry reached on an infield single with one out on a ball off the end of his bat.\n\nThat will loaded the bases with one out for a Jose Ramirez v. Tarik Skubal matchup. It doesn't get better than that.\n\nKerry Carpenter gives Tigers first lead of ALDS Game 5\n\nKerry Carpenter wasn't in the starting lineup due to a hamstring injury, but with the righty Andrew Walters on the mound in the fourth inning, the Tigers picked the right moment.\n\nWalters walked Trey Sweeney to put a runner on first. Carpenter, who is in obvious discomfort and can barely run, worked the count and then drilled a go-ahead, RBI single to the gap in right-center field. Sweeney beat the relay throw home in a close play. Carpenter ended up on first, though most hitters would have been on second. But he did his job, giving the Tigers the lead.\n\nErik Sabrowski keeps Guardians-Tigers scoreless after Spencer Torkelson double\n\nSpencer Torkelson drilled a double off the left-field wall with two outs against Cade Smith, which led to the Guardians turning to Erik Sabrowski.\n\nWith two on and two outs, Sabrowski induced an inning-ending 6-3 groundout.\n\nSmith now has a record 12 strikeouts in this series, the most for a reliever in ALDS history.\n\nIt's still scoreless in Cleveland.\n\nTarik Skubal escapes bases-loaded jam in third inning\n\nThe Guardians had a golden opportunity to break through against Skubal but couldn't make it count.\n\nBrayan Rocchio, who is having a really nice series, singled and was followed by Steven Kwan, who sent a ball down the left-field line that was somehow missed by left fielder Riley Greene. What should have been an out turned into a double.\n\nDavid Fry then struck out as the second out of the inning, which led to Jose Ramirez being intentionally walked with first base open.\n\nThat set up a massive matchup with the bases loaded and two outs between Lane Thomas and Skubal, but he popped out to first base to end the inning.\n\nGame 5 remains scoreless heading to the top of the fourth.\n\nCade Smith entering ALDS Game 5; Guardians-Tigers still tied\n\nCade Smith is entering the game in the third inning.\n\nThe Guardians want as many outs as possible to be thrown by Smith, Clase and perhaps a few others.\n\nBoyd gave up a hit and struck out five in his nine batters faced.\n\nThis game is now the league's best starter (Skubal) against the league's best bullpen.\n\nGuardians-Tigers score: Matthew Boyd again escapes damage\n\nMatthew Boyd has twice worked a high-wire act and escaped any harm.\n\nIn the second inning, Park Meadows doubled down the left-field line and then with one out stole third base, putting the go-ahead run at third base.\n\nJake Rogers then hit a fly-out, but not deep enough to score Meadows from third, and Trey Sweeney was struck out to end the inning.\n\nBoyd has five strikeouts in two innings. Cade Smith is already warming up in the bullpen, which isn't much of a surprise. It's all-hands-on-deck for the Guardians, and there's little incentive to push Boyd too far as the Tigers run through their order a second time.\n\nTarik Skubal works scoreless inning; Guardians-Tigers update\n\nSteven Kwan reached on an infield single, but Tarik Skubal easily dispatched the next three hitters to get through the first inning without any damage.\n\nIt's scoreless after one inning.\n\nKwan now has a 10-game hit streak in the postseason, tying Kenny Lofton for the longest in club history.\n\nGuardians-Tigers ALDS Game 5 score; Matthew Boyd works around danger in first inning\n\nThe first inning didn't get off to the best start for Matthew Boyd, but he recovered.\n\nBoyd hit Justyn-Henry Malloy with the first pitch of the game and later issued a walk. But with two outs, Boyd reared back and struck out Wenceel Perez with a fastball to end the inning unscathed. Boyd let out a yell as he walked off the mound.\n\nBoyd struck out the side, and his 94.9 mph fastball to end the inning was the fastest pitch he's thrown since the 2021 season.\n\nCarlos Carrasco tosses first pitch to Shane Bieber ahead of Guardians-Tigers ALDS Game 5\n\nCarlos Carrasco tossed the ceremonial first pitch to Shane Bieber before Game 5 today.\n\nCarrasco finished the regular season in Triple-A Columbus and Bieber was lost for the year after needing Tommy John surgery. Both received a loud ovation.\n\nCavaliers star Donovan Mitchell leads Progressive Field crowd in \"Let's go Guards!\" chant\n\nThe Cavs are representing at Progressive Field ahead of Game 5 today.\n\nGuards Donovan Mitchell and Darius Garland and center Tristan Thompson are all in attendance for the game. Mitchell took the mic and led Guardians fans in a \"Let's Go Guards! Let's Go Guards!\" chant.\n\nBelow is some pregame information.\n\nWhen is ALDS Game 5 between the Guardians and Tigers?\n\nGame 5 has a first-pitch time of 1:08 p.m. ET. The game was moved up seven hours due to incoming inclement weather in Cleveland Saturday night.\n\nCleveland Guardians ALDS Game 5 lineup\nSteven Kwan, LF\nDavid Fry, DH\nJose Ramirez, 3B\nLane Thomas, CF\nJosh Naylor, 1B\nJhoneknsy Noel, RF\nBo Naylor, C\nAndres Gimenez, 2B\nBrayan Rocchio, SS\n\nOf note, Bo Naylor is starting at catcher today over Austin Hedges, who caught Boyd in Game 2.

They last met in 2022, with the Yankees taking their ALDS in five games.\n\nGM 5 CLE WINS 3-2\nDetroit\nTigers\n3\nFINAL\n7\nCleveland\nGuardians\nCLE -104 OVER 6\n\nGame 1 is Monday in the Bronx.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThomas had five RBIs for the Guardians, who weren't expected to contend this season. But they won the tough AL Central under first-year manager Stephen Vogt, and Cleveland is still alive with a chance to end a World Series title drought stretching to 1948.\n\nThe Guardians had to take down Skubal, the front-runner for the AL Cy Young Award, to keep it going. The left-hander had not given up a run in 24 consecutive innings — 17 in this postseason — before the Guardians tagged him in the fifth for five runs, tying the most he allowed in 2024.\n\nAnd Cleveland did with its familiar, scrappy style dubbed \"Guards Ball,\" getting three singles — one an infield roller — to load the bases before Skubal hit All-Star José Ramírez on the left hand to force in a run.\n\nThat brought up Thomas, who hit a three-run homer in Cleveland's 7-0 win in Game 1.\n\nThe center fielder, who struggled in his first month with the Guardians after coming over in a July trade from Washington, connected on Skubal's first pitch, sending it just over the 19-foot-high wall in left-center field.\n\nSportmode voor hem en haar tot -70% korting.

Write better with Grammarly.\nGrammarly|Sponsored\nThe moments that helped ignite the Padres-Dodgers rivalry ahead of NLDS Game 5\nThe Padres and Dodgers have already provided several memorable moments in their latest NLDS matchup. Here are the moments that helped spark the rivlary.\nJets' Aaron Rodgers takes blame for Robert Saleh firing: 'I play better, this doesn't happen'\nJets QB Aaron Rodgers took responsibility for Robert Saleh's firing on Thursday, saying \"this doesn't happen\" if he had played better to this point.\n\nWhen the ball touched down, the Guardians' dugout emptied and the screaming, red-clad Progressive Field crowd erupted in celebration.\n\nAs has been the case all season, Vogt leaned on his MLB-best bullpen, which showed some wear and tear.\n\nAfter Thomas hit his homer, the Tigers threatened in the sixth, scoring a run on a single by Jake Rogers and loading the bases with two outs. But Hunter Gaddis struck out Kerry Carpenter, who won Game 2 with a three-run homer in the ninth.\n\nThe Tigers, though, kept clawing and closed to 5-3 on Colt Keith's one-out RBI double in the seventh. Eli Morgan came in for Cleveland and struck out both batters he faced.\n\nThomas hit an RBI single in the eighth to put the Guardians up by three, and that's when Vogt turned to All-Star closer Emmanuel Clase, the AL's saves leader, to put the Tigers away.\n\nThrowing one 100 mph fastball after another, Clase got the final six outs. When he retired Keith on a routine grounder to first, the Guardians could finally exhale and plan for their first ALCS visit since 2016.\n\nSkubal lost for the first time since Aug. 2, and the Tigers, who missed a chance to eliminate the Guardians at Comerica Park on Thursday, had their unimaginable late-season push end in disappointment.\n\nOut of contention in August, Detroit regrouped and rerouted its season. Energized by some kids they brought up from the minors, the Tigers took off and went 31-13 after Aug. 11 to earn a postseason berth — one of three AL Central teams to make it.\n\nThey then swept Houston in the wild-card round before meeting Cleveland in the postseason for the first time after more than 2,300 games between the franchises.\n\nThe Guardians took hold of first place in April and never let go. Cleveland became one of the season's biggest surprises, winning 92 games under Vogt, a former journeyman catcher who had no previous managerial experience.\n\nBefore the game, Vogt was confident his team wasn't done.\n\n\"It feels like we're going to New York,\" said Vogt.\n\nThe Guardians are on their way.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nTigers: Carpenter wasn't in the starting lineup due to a hamstring injury suffered in Game 4. He didn't have much time to heal with the quick turnaround and MLB's decision to switch the start time from 8:08 p.m. to 1:08. Carpenter entered in the fifth as a pinch hitter and singled home Trey Sweeney for a 1-0 lead.\n\nReporting by The Associated Press. \n\nSHARE\nMLB TRENDING\nThe moments that helped ignite the Padres-Dodgers rivalry ahead of NLDS Game 5\nMLB moves start of Tigers-Guardians decisive ALDS Game 5 from night to day\nDodgers blank Padres in Game 5, advance to NLCS\nVIEW MORE\nGet more from Major League Baseball\nFollow your favorites to get information about games, news and more\nFOLLOW\nIN THIS TOPIC\nDetroit Tigers\nLane Thomas\nMajor League Baseball\nTarik Skubal\nLane Thomas\nNew York Yankees\nDetroit Tigers\nCleveland Guardians\nMLB - Detroit Tigers vs. Cleveland Guardians - 10/12/2024\n\tSPONSORED CONTENT\nDeze videodeurbel is dе hit vаn 2024 en kost bijnа niets\nNu videodeurbel met gratis installatie.

      "content": "'It's going to sting': Guardians slam door on Tigers' magical run in Game 5\nCHRIS MCCOSKY   The Detroit News\n\nCleveland — It’s going to take some time. The wounds from this one are deep and will take a while to scab over and heal.\n\nBut eventually the sting will subside and the magnitude of what this young Tigers team accomplished this season will sink in, heads will lift and chests will swell with pride.\n\nJust not today.\n\n\"I have a heartbroken team for all the right reasons,\" manager AJ Hinch said after the Tigers' season ended with a 7-3 loss to the Cleveland Guardians in Game 5 of the American League Division Series. \"We left everything we could on the field against a really good team. We didn't want the season to end as abruptly as it did.\n\n\"So I thanked them. I thanked them for everything that they're about in that room. I'm really proud to be the manager and represent them and get to run the team on the field because of who they are and what they're about.\"\n\nThis gloriously improbable two-month spree ended, for all intents and purposes, with a sucker punch. Lane Thomas, who stranded the bases loaded in the third inning, delivered what in Cleveland will forever be an iconic grand slam home run off ace Tarik Skubal in a five-run fifth inning.\n\n\"Just one pitch,\" said Skubal, who took a streak of 17 straight scoreless playoff innings into that inning. \"What a swing. The moment was the moment and I'd love to have it back. … Obviously not the outcome you want, but I am so proud of this team. It's incredible what we did. We should be proud.\"\n\nThat was the prevailing mood of the clubhouse. No champagne, but no tears, either. Disappointment, for sure, but also a sense that something magical was experienced for the first time and it created a thirst for more of it.\n\n\"I think we are here to stay,\" said Kerry Carpenter, who, despite an injured left hamstring, delivered a clutch pinch-hit RBI single. \"There's a bunch of young players who want to get better and are going to use this offseason to get better. I think everybody in this organization is really excited.\n\n\"We put the world on notice that we can do big things in this clubhouse with these guys.\"\n\nThat was Hinch's message to his team in the clubhouse afterward.\n\nAJ Hinch's message to the team after Game 5 loss in Cleveland\nChris McCosky asks AJ Hinch about his postgame message after 7-3 loss to Guardians.\n\n\"I let them know there's only one team that doesn't have this pit in your stomach at the end of the year, and we were the next one to go through it,\" he said. \"I know it's going to sting, but we're also going to use it as fuel to get to next spring.\n\n\"I told the guys this earlier, once you play in one October, you never want to miss one the rest of your career, ever. So we're going to need to do a lot of work to get better and continue to play the brand of baseball that is winning baseball.\"\n\nBut what a run it’s been for the Tigers. They were eight games under .500 and given up for dead on Aug. 10. They traded four veteran players at the trade deadline and designated Gio Urshela and Shelby Miller for assignment.\n\nBOX SCORE: Guardians 7, Tigers 3\n\nThen, as Carpenter, Riley Greene and Parker Meadows returned to the lineup healthy, as Hinch and pitching coach Chris Fetter creatively restructured the pitching staff deploying openers and bulk relievers, as young players like Trey Sweeney, Wenceel Perez and Colt Keith started to find their footing, they started to win.\n\nThey rolled into their first postseason in 10 years on a 31-13 run and then went into Houston and beat the playoff-seasoned Astros two straight in the Wild Card Series to advance to the ALDS.\n\nThen on Thursday in Game 4, they were seven outs away from eliminating the Guardians at Comerica Park before David Fry turned the game and series around with a late two-run homer.\n\nIt was a two-month joy ride that sports fans in Detroit will be talking about long after the disappointment of Game 5 dissipates.\n\n\"It was incredible,\" Hinch said. \"Our guys, what we had to do to galvanize ourselves and put together stretches of good baseball as the notoriety enhanced, as the expectations rose, as the attention grew, we did an incredible job as a group of just staying grounded and trying to do our best every day, and it led us to where we are.\n\n\"And our players, our coaches, our organization never flinched. We never thought that we shouldn't be here, and that is going to fuel us moving forward, and we're going to be a problem for people if we can continue that mindset and continue that hunger to feel this.\"\n\nIt looked for a brief minute like the ride would continue Saturday when they dramatically took a 1-0 lead in the top of the fifth.  \n\nThe talk before the game centered on Carpenter’s injured left hamstring. Could he play? Could he at least give the Tigers one clutch swing? Hinch kept his cards hidden before the game, saying only that he hoped Carpenter would be available off the bench.\n\nBut this entire series has played out like a Hollywood script, so of course, Carpenter got his Kirk Gibson moment.\n\n\"If I could go, I wanted to go for these guys,\" Carpenter said. \"That was my driving reason. I wanted to be here for this team if I could contribute.\"\n\nHe could and did.\n\nAgainst right-handed reliever Andrew Walters, Hinch sent Carpenter up to hit for Justyn-Henry Malloy. Sweeney, who had walked, was on first. Walters threw three straight balls but Carpenter was hacking on 3-0, fouling off a middle-middle fastball.\n\nHe got another fastball on 3-1 and obliterated it, lining it to the base of the wall in right-center. Carpenter limped to first base and stopped as Sweeney motored all the way home, sliding just head of the relay throw.\n\n\"Super gratifying,\" said Carpenter, who struck out in his next two at-bats, including with the bases loaded in the sixth. \"Such a blessing. These guys deserve my best. That's what I had to give them. It was pretty painful, but I could swing the bat.\"\n\nSkubal had been in complete control of the game through four innings, allowing two hits with five strikeouts.\n\n\"Skubal is the best starting pitcher in the game right now,\" Guardians manager Stephen Vogt said. \"We saw him five days ago and our guys showed up confident today. We didn't know when it was going to happen, but every single person that walked in our clubhouse today believed we were going to get to him.\n\n\"And we were fortunate to do that because he has had an unbelievable year. He's an unbelievable pitcher. I have a ton of respect for him and what he's done in this game. He's going to be really good for a very long time, and we were very fortunate to get to him today.\"\n\nSingles by No. 8 hitter Andres Gimenez and pesky leadoff hitter Steven Kwan (three three-hit games in the series) put Skubal under duress in the bottom of the fifth. An infield single by Fry loaded the bases with one out for Guardians superstar Jose Ramirez.\n\nSkubal drilled Ramirez in the left arm with a 99-mph fastball, forcing in the tying run. Ramirez, after being tended to by the trainer, stayed in the game.\n\nThomas ambushed the next pitch, a center-cut 97-mph sinker. The ball left his bat at 107.7 mph and flew 396 feet over the high wall in left.\n\nIt was a dagger to the heart.\n\n\"I don't think I'm going to sleep tonight,\" Skubal said. \"It'll suck, and it should suck, but this is only going to make me strive to become a better version of myself. In those days in the offseason that get a little grueling…I'll just make sure to remind myself of this feeling I have right now.\"\n\nThe Tigers had Skubal's back afterward.\n\n\"He could've given up 100 runs today and I'd still take him over anybody,\" catcher Jake Rogers said. \"Lane was a pain in my butt in this series. It was supposed to be a sinker in and it leaked over the plate. Lane did what he was supposed to do.\"\n\nThe Tigers continued to scrap. They forced Vogt to empty his bullpen again. But the last six outs belonged to closer Emmanuel Clase and he slammed the door rudely on the Tigers' dream run.\n\n\"It's going to hurt for a little bit,\" Greene said. \"We busted our butts from Game 1 on and we came up short. It's the way baseball goes. But super proud of this group. Nobody thought we'd be here except us. It is going to hurt but when it stops hurting — maybe in a week or a month — we're going to remember all the fun we had.\n\n\"You can get caught up in the game, the intensity and nerves, but we just had fun. So much fun. Just seeing the smiles on everyone's faces every day. It was just that no-quit factor. We never quit. We always felt like we had a shot.\"\n\nGame over. Season over. Memories forever.\n\n\"We're back being a winning organization,\" Hinch said. \"And we earned it. We're going to have to back it up now with a good offseason, a good spring with growing expectations and a group of players that is now battle-tested at the highest level to date.\n\n\"I'm proud that we had a winning record. I'm proud we played winning baseball. I'm proud that we got a chance to test ourselves in a heartfelt series against a team we respect and a team we expect to see a lot of next year.\"\n\nchris.mccosky@detroitnews.com\n\n@cmccosky\n\n \n \n ",

The Nittany Lions came back three times to tie it in the final 20 minutes, including Nicholas Singleton's 14-yard TD reception with 2:53 left.\n\nQuinten Joyner scored two early TDs for the Trojans (3-3, 1-3), who have lost three of four. USC hasn't beaten a top-five team since the Trojans held off No. 5 Penn State in a 52-49 thriller of a Rose Bowl in January 2017.\n\nWarren racked up 224 yards and a touchdown, although his only catch after the third quarter was a 3-yarder in overtime. The senior set a record for the most receptions by an opponent in USC's 137-year football history.\n\nThe Nittany Lions started slowly on their long road trip, but finished impressively. After going up 3-0 on its first drive, Penn State didn't lead again in regulation and trailed 20-6 at halftime before its offense got moving.\n\nUSC's Kyron Hudson caught a go-ahead touchdown pass from Miller Moss with 5:56 left, but Allar converted two fourth downs with desperate passes for Penn State before Singleton was left all alone for his tying catch.\n\nUSC drove to midfield in the final seconds, but Lincoln Riley curiously used no timeouts extend the Trojans' drive before Jaylen Reed picked off Moss with 5 seconds left.\n\nUSC went 3 yards backward on its first three plays of overtime before Michael Lantz missed a 45-yard field goal attempt. Penn State advanced to the 19, and Barker buried the winner.\n\nMoss passed for 220 yards and two scores, while Joyner rushed for a 75-yard TD in the first quarter and caught a 9-yard TD pass in the second quarter for the Trojans. Woody Marks rushed for 111 yards for USC.\n\nPenn State had a healthy contingent of fans at the Coliseum for its first lengthy road trip in the new Big Ten and its longest trip for any regular-season game since 1991.\n\nBut USC's defense kept Penn State out of the end zone in the first half despite playing without injured linebacker Eric Gentry, its sacks leader and second-leading tackler, and starting cornerback Jacobe Covington.\n\nJoyner put the Trojans ahead early when he faked a reverse and rumbled 75 yards through the heart of Penn State's defense. He added his first career TD catch moments later.\n\nPenn State responded to its 14-point halftime deficit with Allar's TD throw to Warren on a double pass. The Nittany Lions made a 90-yard march to tie it moments later, with Kaytron Allen taking it in.\n\nEaston Mascarenas-Arnold's interception led to USC's third field goal late in the third, but Penn State tied it again with 10:50 to play after its next drive stalled at the 3.\n\nTakeaway\n\nPenn State: The Nittany Lions celebrated vehemently after a victory that was thrilling, but not stunning. Their slow start and rough overall defensive performance don't bode well for Ohio State or other opponents with less inconsistency than mercurial USC.\n\nUSC: The Trojans responded impressively from last week's loss, but still can't finish.\n\nUp Next\n\nUSC: At Maryland on Oct. 19.\n\nPrint Friendly Version\nRead Full Article\nScoring Summary\nScoring Summary\n1st Quarter\tPSU\tUSC\n\n04:53 - PSU - Barker,Ryan 34 yd field goal 14 plays, 72 yards, TOP 07:57\n\t3\t0\n\n04:38 - USC - Joyner,Quinten 75 yd run (Lantz,Michael kick), 1 plays, 75 yards, TOP 00:15\n\t3\t7\n2nd Quarter\tPSU\tUSC\n\n13:33 - USC - Joyner,Quinten 9 yd pass from Moss,Miller (Lantz,Michael kick) 7 plays, 89 yards, TOP 03:16\n\t3\t14\n\n10:05 - USC - Lantz,Michael 45 yd field goal 4 plays, -2 yards, TOP 02:10\n\t3\t17\n\n02:46 - PSU - Barker,Ryan 33 yd field goal 10 plays, 64 yards, TOP 03:12\n\t6\t17\n\n00:07 - USC - Lantz,Michael 47 yd field goal 7 plays, 49 yards, TOP 02:35\n\t6\t20\n3rd Quarter\tPSU\tUSC\n\n12:52 - PSU - Warren,Tyler 32 yd pass from Allar,Drew (Barker,Ryan kick) 5 plays, 75 yards, TOP 02:08\n\t13\t20\n\n04:42 - PSU - Allen,Kaytron 1 yd run (Barker,Ryan kick), 8 plays, 90 yards, TOP 04:34\n\t20\t20\n\n00:28 - USC - Lantz,Michael 39 yd field goal 4 plays, 2 yards, TOP 00:59\n\t20\t23\n4th Quarter\tPSU\tUSC\n\n10:50 - PSU - Barker,Ryan 20 yd field goal 9 plays, 72 yards, TOP 04:38\n\t23\t23\n\n05:56 - USC - Hudson,Kyron 5 yd pass from Moss,Miller (Lantz,Michael kick) 9 plays, 75 yards, TOP 04:54\n\t23\t30\n\n02:53 - PSU - Singleton,Nicholas 14 yd pass from Allar,Drew (Barker,Ryan kick) 12 plays, 75 yards, TOP 03:03\n\t30\t30\nOT Quarter\tPSU\tUSC\n\n00:00 - PSU - Barker,Ryan 36 yd field goal 4 plays, 6 yards, TOP 00:00\n\t33\t30\nRelated Headlines\n\nHow To Watch, Listen And Follow: USC Football vs. No. 4 Penn State\n\nUSC Football Hosts No. 4 Penn State At L.A.

USC leads Penn State 7-3 with 4:53 left in the first quarter.\n\nPenn State takes early lead\n\nPenn State has to finish a 14-play drive with a 34-yard field goal to take the early 3-0 lead with 4:53 left in the first quarter. The Trojans held strong and denied Penn State on three straight attempts in the red zone.

The Trojans produced just 15 yards on the drive before being forced to punt.

But we think there will be seven must-see games in Week 7: No. 2 Ohio State at No. 3 Oregon, No. 1 Texas vs. No. 16 Oklahoma, No. 8 Mississippi at No. 10 LSU, No. 5 Penn State at Southern California, South Carolina at No. 7 Alabama, No. 19 Kansas State at Colorado and California at No. 24 Pittsburgh.\n\nEddie Timanus breaks down all seven contests here.\n\nD'Anton Lynn coaching against Penn State\n\nUSC defensive coordinator D'Anton Lynn is coaching against his alma mater, Penn State, for the first time today. Lynn was a three-time All-Big Ten Conference honorable mention as a cornerback for the Nittany Lions from 2008-11. He finished his college career with 162 total tackles (seven for a loss), four interceptions and a fumble recovery in 47 games played. He started 37 of his last 38 games.\n\nHe spent several years as an assistant coach in the NFL before joining the college ranks as a first-year defensive coordinator at UCLA in 2023. D'Anton is the son of former Chargers head coach Anthony Lynn.\n\nUS LBM Coaches Poll \n\nThe latest US LBM Coaches Poll had some major shakeups after some unexpected results in Week 6, and the top five looks slightly different from the preseason version. No. 3 Oregon jumped up three spots in the poll, while No. 7 Alabama and No. 9 Tennessee both fell five spots after each lost in SEC play. No. 5 Penn State moved up two spots, while USC dropped out completely after being ranked No. 15 the previous week.\n\nNick Singleton expected to play\n\nPenn State running back Nick Singleton is expected to play against USC. Singleton was not listed on the injury report as \"questionable\" or \"out\" when it was released prior to the game. He missed last week's home game against UCLA.\n\nHe was participating in drills during the pregame.\n\nCollege football bowl projections \n\nAfter a wild Week 6 of college football, there were some significant changes for the USA TODAY Sports bowl projections. There were four upsets among the top 10 teams, and the impact could be felt from the College Football Playoff down to the rest of the postseason lineup in this week's bowl projections. Leading the winners was idle Texas. The Longhorns are now the top seed following Alabama's stunning loss to Vanderbilt. The Crimson Tide remain in the playoff field but now are slated for a first-round game. — Erick Smith \n\nCollege football Re-Rank 1-134\n\nWith Alabama out of the picture after a stunning loss to Vanderbilt, Texas fends off Ohio State and takes over as the new No. 1 in the USA TODAY Sports Re-Rank 1-134.\n\nThat makes three teams at No. 1 in as many weeks. Georgia led the re-rank from the preseason until the loss to the Crimson Tide. — Paul Myerberg \n\nCollege football overreactions from Week 6 \n\nThe random nature of sports makes it impossible to foresee every game’s outcome. A whole lot of well-lit buildings in the desert stand as testimony to this reality.\n\nCollege football is especially prone to such randomness. Most of the time, analysts might feel like they have a handle on which team might prevail in a head-to-head encounter. Then there are Saturdays like the one we’ve just witnessed that make us question our entire worldview.\n\nAn overreaction? Perhaps, but that’s what we’re here for in this space. Here are the top five overreactions from Week 6, one of the most chaotic in recent memory. — Eddie Timanus \n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

This weekend's showdown will mark the 11th meeting between the proud programs and the first since USC's 52-49 win in the Rose Bowl over Penn State in 2017. The Trojans lead the all-time series 6-4.\n\nThe Trojans are coming off a disappointing 24-17 loss to Minnesota. USC had dropped two of its first three games as a member of the Big Ten, and a loss to Penn State would make the climb to an at-large bid to the 12-team College Football Playoff a steep one. USC had scored at least 20 points in 27 consecutive games -- the second-longest streak in program history -- before a 17-point output in the loss to the Golden Gophers, \n\nThe Nittany Lions are coming off a a 27-11 win over UCLA at home and are the only FBS program to start 5-0 in each of the last four seasons. With a win over USC, Penn State would be 6-0 in back-to-back years for the first time since starting 11-0 in 1985 and having a perfect 12-0 campaign in 1986.\n\nHere is everything you need to know before USC's first matchup against Penn State in the regular season since 2000.\n\nFollow along with LIVE UPDATES as Penn State clashes with USC on Saturday. \n\nHow to watch Penn State vs. USC live\n\nDate: Saturday, Oct. 12 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ET\nLocation: Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Stadium -- Los Angeles\nTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App (Free)\nStreaming on Paramount+ with Showtime (Try It Free)\n\nPenn State vs. USC: Need to know\n\nPenn State needs more explosive plays: Penn State quarterback Drew Allar has completed 8 of 12 passes on attempts of more than 20 yards, according to Pro Football Focus. Those explosive plays have accounted for only 11.7% of Allar's total attempts, but the sample size is big enough for Penn State Andy Kotelnicki to dial up more home run shots down the field. Allar has completed 70.9% of his total attempts for 1,101 yards and nine touchdowns, but Penn State's receiving leader is TE Tyler Warren, who has 23 catches for 289 yards. Only three wide receivers (Harrison Wallace lll, Omari Evans and Liam Clifford) have more than 180 receiving yards. \n\nPenn State will face its biggest test against a stout USC secondary that has allowed only 157.6 passing yards per game -- 13th-best in the FBS. If Penn State can find success in the passing game against the best pass defense they have faced so far this season, it will good omen for what Allar and company can do going forward.\n\nLincoln Riley needs a big win to change the narrative: Riley has struggled against college football's best teams since he got to USC. Riley is 0-2 against AP top-10 opponents and 4-8 against ranked opponents at USC. When Riley was at Oklahoma, the Sooners went 16-6 against ranked foes and 7-4 vs. top-10 opponents. Riley has lost last four games against top-five teams and have allowed more than 45 points in all of those matchups. With USC's CFP hopes on life support, a win over Penn State would help start to change the narrative and get USC back on track.\n\nPenn State's College Football Playoff outlook: Penn State is in a prime position to make its first appearance in the CFP. The Nittany Lions have one ranked opponent left on the schedule (No. 2 Ohio State on Nov. 2) and an 11-1 finish would almost certainly get them into the field. Penn State already has wins over West Virginia and Illinois on its résumé, and USC might be the second-best team it faces in conference play. Securing a win over the Trojans on the road would go a long way toward getting into the CFP and potentially the Big Ten title game.\n\nPenn State vs. USC prediction, picks\n\nThe biggest question coming into the season was how USC's defense would perform. At the midway point, there are more questions around Riley's offense than a group that has shown flashes under first-year defensive coordinator D'Anton Lynn. Penn State and USC have been two of the best passing defenses in the country, so this game may come down to who can control the trenches and who can run the football better. Penn State has a dynamic one-two punch in the backfield with Nicholas Singleton and Kaytron Allen, so the advantage in that department should go to the road team. Pick: Penn State -5.5\n\n\n\nDennis Dodd\n\t\nTom Fornelli\n\t\nChip Patterson\n\t\nShehan Jeyarajah\n\t\nDavid Cobb\n\t\nJerry Palm\n\t\nBrandon Marcello\n\t\nRichard Johnson\n\n\nPSU -5.5\nPenn State\n\t\nPenn State\n\t\nPenn State\n\t\nPenn State\n\t\nUSC\n\t\nPenn State\n\t\nPenn State\n\t\nUSC\n\n\nSU\nPenn State\n\t\nPenn State\n\t\nPenn State\n\t\nPenn State\n\t\nUSC\n\t\nPenn State\n\t\nPenn State\n\t\nPenn State\n\nWhich college football picks can you make with confidence in Week 7? Visit SportsLine to see which teams will win and cover the spread -- all from a proven computer model that has returned over $2,000 in profit since its inception -- and find out.",

      "content": "USC Trojans' Lincoln Riley: 'We've Played The Toughest Schedule In The Country'\nIn a must-win game, the USC Trojans blow a 17-point lead on their home field to lose a 33-30 game in overtime. Littered with missed opportunities and questionable decisions, this brutal loss buries any college football playoff hope.\nKyron Samuels | 10 Hours Ago\nOct 12, 2024; Los Angeles, California, USA; USC Trojans head coach Lincoln Riley, left, talks with Penn State Nittany Lions head coach James Franklin on the field prior to the game at United Airlines Field at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images / Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images\nIn this story:\nUSC Trojans\nPenn State Nittany Lions\n\nThe USC Trojans had preseason goals that included making the college football playoff this season. Coming into the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum hosting a Big Ten conference game against No. 4 Penn State, the Trojans’ backs were against the wall. There was no way around it, this was a must-win game. \n\nAt the end of a seesaw game where USC was in control for most of the game, the Trojans suffered arguably the most crushing loss of Lincoln Riley’s tenure with a 33-30 overtime home loss. Lincoln Riley is 11-10 in his last 21 games as coach. The Trojans are now 3-3 overall and 1-3 in Big Ten conference play. The playoff dream is officially dead. \n\n“The reality is, we've played the toughest schedule in the country. The first six games. We've had a chance to win every single game, and that's hard to do. Like to put yourself in position to win these games is freaking hard to do to begin with. So we're doing a lot of good, and I understand that that good's not going to get seen by the outside right now, because they're going to focus on the record and the fact that we've lost three games in the last play.“\n\nOct 12, 2024; Los Angeles, California, USA; USC Trojans quarterback Miller Moss (7) throws a pass in the first half against the Penn State Nittany Lions United Airlines Field at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images / Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images\n\nAt face value, Riley’s postgame comments sound nice. It’s great coach-speak, but it’s devoid of accountability and context. The USC Trojans had the best first half of the Lincoln Riley era. The Trojans finished the first half with 147 yards rushing. They came into the game averaging 149 rushing yards per game. \n\nThe defense held Penn State to six first-half points and held a 20-6 lead at the break. You couldn’t have asked for a better start. Once again, it looked like the Trojans were turning a corner and finally playing up to their capabilities. They’ve shown they can do it in spurts, but it’s never been sustained. \n\nHistory repeated itself in the second half in the worst way possible for this USC team and Lincoln Riley. In less than three minutes, Penn State scored a touchdown. It was a 20-20 ball game in less than ten minutes. Just like that, the lead was gone.\n\nIt happened again. For the second consecutive week, USC was in control of a game with a chance to stop all opposing momentum and began to fall apart. With 17 point lead evaporated, the Trojans showed some resolve to fight back and take a 23-20 lead and then a 30-23 lead. \n\nThere was 5:56 left in the game and a 30-23 USC lead. One stop virtually ends the game. Not only did Penn State drive 75 yards in 12 plays, they converted back-breaking 4th downs. 4th and seven and once more on 4th and 10.  Penn State scored to tie the game at 30-30. As good as the defense has been most of the season, this marks the third game they’ve given up a game-tying or game-winning drive in regulation. \n\nOct 12, 2024; Los Angeles, California, USA; USC Trojans head coach Lincoln Riley walks off the field following the game against the Penn State Nittany Lions at United Airlines Field at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images / Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images\n\nLincoln Riley’s late-game clock management once again was questionable as the Trojans inexplicably mismanaged their timeouts and handcuffed themselves as time waned. The Trojans, who had opportunity after opportunity to finish the game, were now in overtime.\n\nThe Trojans' offense got the ball first and went three and out. Then kicker Michael Lantz missed a 45-yard field goal. Penn State set up their kicker Ryan Barker for a 36-yard field goal and he drilled it. The Trojans once again found a way to lose a ball game they had full control over. \n\n\"You have to keep perspective…If you change two plays this year, then we're 5-0, and we feel like we're world beaters and we're worried about being over confident,\" \n\nThat was Lincoln Riley’s message on Monday after another fourth quarter collapse against Minnesota. \n\n“Yeah, shoot, they, you know, they all hurt. You know, this one especially was excruciating, just in the, you know, the manner that had happened. I think, you know, the flip side of that is that, you know, we've got a really, really good locker room for really great people and really great coaches that's going to continue to stay together, come go out and run this back half of the season. That's the number four in the country. So what does that make us? said Miller Moss after the game.\n\nAt some point, the sentiment expressed by the coaches and team has to translate to wins. There’s no more playoff talk. There’s no more championship talk. This team might be lucky to make a bowl game. Being close to being a good team isn’t enough at USC.\n\nMORE: How to Watch USC Trojans vs. Penn State Nittany Lions: Preview, Prediction, Channel\n\nMORE: USC Trojans' Jaylin Smith Reveals Strategy for Defending Penn State's Drew Allar\n\nMORE: [EXCLUSIVE] USC Trojans' Juju Watkins Signs NIL Deal With Gatorade: 'Surreal Dream'\n\nMORE: USC Trojans Recruiting: 4-Star Julian Lewis Headlines Visitors List vs. Penn State\n\nMORE: Minnesota Vikings' Sam Darnold To Lead USC Trojans Out of Tunnel vs. Penn State\n\nMORE: USC Trojans Injury Update vs. Penn State: Lake McRee, Eric Gentry, Anthony Lucas \n\nPublished 10 Hours Ago\nKYRON SAMUELS\n\nKyron Samuels is a former college and professional football player now a writer, analyst, & digital host.

      "content": "Lincoln Riley is 11-10 in his last 21 games, 5-8 in his last 13, 4-6 in his last 10. USC is struggling. But Lincoln Riley says the record doesn’t tell the full story.\n\n“They’re going to focus on the record and the fact that we lost three games on the last play, and I understand that’s part of it. We all knew this when we signed up for big boy football, so I get it,” Riley said.\n\n“I have to do a better job within the games. I have to do a better job, our coaches, our players, because we’re doing too many good things… We gotta be able to finish and that falls on my shoulders at the end. That’s part of why they call me head coach.”\n\nA loss to No. 4 Penn State, especially a close one, may be more forgivable than losses to the currently unranked Minnesota and Michigan, but how the loss came about will sting all the same.\n\nUSC took an early lead and lost it. It fought hard to take it back, and did so. Then, the Trojans fell apart.\n\n“I’ve had, obviously, a few games like this,” Riley said. “We’ve had chances to win right there at the end, and to not make the plays, not have some of the breaks bounce your way. It’s a gut punch, there’s no doubt about it.”\n\nAfter opening the game with an ineffective drive, USC promptly allowed Penn State to drive to inside the five, but forced a field goal after an offensive pass interference penalty took a touchdown off the scoreboard on fourth down.\n\nUSC got the ball back and called a fake reverse that let redshirt freshman RB Quinten Joyner sail 75 yards to the end zone to take a 7-3 lead.\n\nAnother penalty on another fourth down attempt sent the Penn State special teams onto the field for the second straight drive, this time to punt. USC once again gained momentum off a trick play, with redshirt senior RB Woody Marks looking to lateral back to QB Miller Moss before tucking the ball and running for 21 yards. Two plays later, Joyner took a shallow pass into the end zone, stretching the lead to 11.\n\nIt continued from there — an interception on the third play of the drive gave USC excellent field position, which ended in a Michael Lantz field goal and a 17-3 lead. Even as Penn State gained momentum after that drive, USC matched their meager scoring to take a 20-6 lead into the half.\n\nAfter the break, Penn State remembered their ranking and marched downfield to score their first touchdown of the game — a 32-yard bomb to senior tight end Tyler Warren, who snapped the ball to start the play before releasing into the endzone. A mix of good defense and bad penalties led USC to punt after facing 3rd and 26. Once again, Penn State drove downfield, this time scoring on a run by junior running back Kaytron Allen. Suddenly, the game was tied.\n\nOn Penn State’s next possession, the Trojan defense showed up — a Kamari Ramsey tip sent the ball into Easton Mascarenas-Arnold’s arms. The offense still sputtered, going three and out and kicking a field goal to take a three point lead.\n\nBack with the ball, the Nittany Lions put their offense on the back of Warren, who eclipsed 200 yards on the drive and tied former Utah TE Dalton Kincaid for the most receptions against USC in program history — a record he broke by the end of the game.\n\n“I’ve talked about him being the best tight end in college football,” James Franklin told reporters after the game. “He is now part of the conversation of one of the best players in college football.”\n\n“He’s a great player. We knew he was going to be a challenge coming in,” Riley concurred. “We had a couple coverage busts on him, and I think that’s the thing we’ll look back on.”\n\nEven with Warren’s continued dominance, however, Penn State couldn’t break the plane of the end zone and once again stalled out inside the 10. They settled for a field goal to once again tie the Trojans.\n\nA new drive for USC brought new life on offense. The first four plays all went to Marks, who gained 37 yards on them. After two plays went away from Marks, the Trojans faced a 3rd and 6, where Duce Robinson made a catch through contact to bring up 1st and Goal. A slant to Kyron Hudson restored a USC lead, now up 30-23.\n\nSuddenly, it was Penn State that struggled on offense. With less than five minutes left, the Nittany Lions had to be aggressive on the multiple fourth downs they faced. But while the Trojans defense could force stops on first, second and third, they allowed conversions on both fourths-and-long, letting Penn State tie the game on a 15-yard swing pass to junior running back Nicholas Singleton.\n\nTie game — three minutes left, three timeouts. What does Lincoln Riley do?\n\nA mix of quick passes and runs moved the ball to USC’s 49 with 50 seconds left and the clock still rolling…\n\nAnd rolling…\n\nAnd rolling until Penn State called a timeout with 14 seconds left.\n\nWith time to think, Riley dialed up a pass to Robinson which Penn State tipped and intercepted. A subsequent Hail Mary attempt by Penn State was also intercepted (by Robinson), sending the game to overtime.\n\nUSC had the first possession and Penn State woke up, knocking USC back three yards and forcing a field goal, which Michael Lantz missed. Penn State gained three, kicked a field goal and drilled it.\n\nQuestions around Lincoln Riley’s clock management are not new; they’ve mounted for years. After his refusal to call a late timeout, those questions are louder than ever. Riley, however, defended the decision after the game.\n\n“We started talking [after losing two yards on first down] about ‘do we need to use timeouts and stop the clock?’” Riley said. “If you don’t get anything there, then it’s third and 12 — you just potentially bought them another series and we weren’t in field goal range yet.”\n\nWith a rotten recent record, questions about his ability already swirling and mounting questions about his job security, Riley wanted to make one thing clear. This is on him and he sees that.\n\n“There is nobody taking more responsibility than I am, so I don’t know where that line of questioning comes from,” Riley snapped. “The reality is we’ve played the toughest schedule in the country. The first six games — we’ve had a chance to win in every single game and that’s hard to do, like to put yourself in position to win these games, it’s freaking hard to do.”",

And by the end, that noise became screams. \n\nFans stormed the field inside Autzen Stadium after third-ranked Oregon outlasted second-ranked Ohio State, 32-31, the second time during this college football season that a meeting of top-10 teams wasn’t decided until the final play.\n\nWeeks after Alabama beat Georgia in an instant classic, the Ducks (6-0) remained unbeaten when Ohio State (5-1), given the ball for one last drive with 1:47 remaining in the fourth quarter, was pushed out of field goal range and saw their last play break down before Will Howard could even attempt a potential end zone heave.\n\nThe matchup was a sign of the current times in college football — a pair of veteran, transfer quarterbacks leading teams separated by nearly 2,500 miles, yet facing off in league play thanks to conference realignment. \n\nAnd this is a matchup that could happen again, in two months, thanks to the expansion of the College Football Playoff. After the first top-five matchup lived up to the hype, who’s up for a rematch in a few months? \n\nHoward completed 28 of his 35 passes for 326 yards and two touchdowns. He dueled with Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabriel, who completed 23 of his 34 passes for 341 yards and also two touchdowns.\n\nUntil the final drive, the difference between teams was so small as to appear nonexistent.\n\nRecommended\n2024 ELECTION\nDNC to skywrite 'Vote Kamala' over the Raiders-Steelers game Sunday\nSOCCER\nU.S. men's soccer begins Pochettino era with 2-0 friendly win over Panama\n\nOregon finished with 14 more rushing yards and 15 more passing yards. Ohio State had the game’s only turnover. Ohio State led 7-6 after one quarter, Oregon 22-21 at halftime, and Ohio State 31-29 with 1:54 to play, as the Ducks faced third and goal, two yards from the end zone and the lead. That run barely gained a yard but led to a 19-yard field goal that pushed Oregon ahead, 32-31. \n\nIt would stand as the game-winning kick when Ohio State’s final drive ended after eight plays and 49 yards, stuck 38 yards from the end zone. Since these teams first met 66 years ago, Ohio State won the first nine matchups, but Oregon has claimed the last two.\n\nIn previous eras, Saturday would have effectively served as a knockout game for the loser’s chances of advancing to the College Football Playoff. That level of pressure on every weekend helped to fuel the sport’s popularity, while also differentiating it from the NFL. \n\nBut Saturday’s back-and-forth result was an example of why the expansion of the playoff this year — to 12 teams — could endure as a good thing. For exactly 60 minutes, both teams looked to be among the very best the country has seen this season. The expansion ensures both, and not only the winner, will have the opportunity to prove that in December, and potentially January, instead of penalizing one for a result on the second weekend in October.\n\nAnd that just might be something worth shouting about.\n\nAndrew Greif\n\nAndrew Greif is a freelance sports journalist. ",

Credit: Samuel Cipriani | Asst. Sports Editor\n\nThe Buckeyes had long circled their matchup with No. 3 Oregon, knowing it would be their biggest test of the season to date.\n\nIt was, however, a test they ultimately failed.\n\nAfter a pseudo onside kick, an Oregon player ejected for spitting on Davison Igbinosun and eight lead changes, Ohio State lost a heartbreaker 32-31 after quarterback Will Howard seemed to mismanage the clock as time ran out. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the Buckeyes down by a point with 1:46 remaining, Howard led Ohio State down the field to the Oregon 43-yard line with six seconds remaining and one timeout. The quarterback evaded pressure, scrambled up the middle and slid down as time expired.\n\n“It sucks,” Howard said. “You don’t want to lose a game like that. I don’t know what we could’ve done better, I could’ve gotten down earlier, gave us a chance; it would’ve been a longer kick.”\n\nHoward finished the game 28-of-35 for 326 yards and two touchdowns. Linebacker Cody Simon led the defense with 10 total tackles.\n\n“This is a team loss,” Ohio State head coach Ryan Day said. “The offense had a chance to go in and finish it off at the end but it didn’t happen. It felt like we were in field goal range there, and we wanted to keep adding to the field goal because every time you add five yards it increases [your chances].\n\nIn his career, Day is 1-7 against top-five teams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“You take a brutal penalty like that that pushes you back — it’s heartbreaking, but that’s football,” Day said.\n\nThe first half brought four lead changes, numerous scoring opportunities and more bizarre plays than the Buckeyes have seen through their first five games, all of which could’ve helped Ohio State come out on top.\n\nHoward rushed for a 1-yard touchdown to put the Buckeyes ahead 7-0 five minutes into the game.\n\nFour minutes later, Oregon defensive lineman Derrick Harmon stripped the ball from Buckeyes running back Quinshon Judkins, and two plays later, Ducks running back Jordan James was in the endzone.\n\nInstead of tying the game at seven apiece, Oregon punter Luke Dunne botched the hold on the extra point, leaving the Buckeyes with a 7-6 lead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe half only got weirder from there.\n\nOhio State quickly punted the ball back to the Ducks after committing three pre-snap penalties to push them behind the sticks, but again, the Buckeyes were bailed out by a Ducks special team mistake.\n\nOregon kicker Atticus Sappington pushed a 44-yard field goal right of the uprights, and Henderson followed with a 53-yard rush. Judkins plowed into the end zone, pushing the Buckeyes to a 14-6 lead.\n\nDucks quarterback Dillon Gabriel found wide receiver Evan Stewart, who got behind cornerback Denzel Burke for a 69-yard grab down the sideline, followed by a miraculous catch by Stewart in the corner of the endzone. \n\nThe Ducks failed at a two-point conversion to tie the game, keeping the score 14-12 Buckeyes. But cornerback Jordan Hancock committed a 15-yard personal foul after the play, allowing the Ducks to kick off from midfield.\n\nAnd Oregon capitalized on the kickoff when kicker Andrew Boyle booted the ball directly at Ohio State safety Caleb Downs, and the Ducks recovered off the ricochet.\n\n“We worked hard this week returning the ball after a penalty on the 50-yard line,” Day said. “We knew they were going to do something like that. That was well-designed by them, but that one hurt.”\n\nThe home team looked to be on its way to a score inside the Buckeyes’ 10-yard line, but Ducks wide receiver Traeshon Holden inexplicably spat on Buckeyes cornerback Davison Igbinosun, resulting in a 15-yard penalty and Holden’s ejection. Oregon settled for a Sappington 27-yard field goal, which gave the Ducks a 15-14 lead.\n\nOhio State pulled ahead 21-15 with 3:53 left in the half when Howard found wide receiver Emeka Egbuka wide-open for a 15-yard touchdown, but its lead didn’t last long.\n\nThree minutes later, Burke got beat again — this time by Ducks wide receiver Tez Johnson — and Gabriel uncorked a 48-yard bomb for a touchdown, giving Oregon a 22-21 lead at the half.\n\nOregon punted on its first drive out of the half, and the Buckeye offense used a six-play, 79-yard drive with a touchdown catch by wide receiver Jeremiah Smith to regain a 28-22 lead.\n\nThe Ducks drove down the field and went for it on fourth-and-goal 2 yards out but watched helplessly as the ball bounced off Buckeye Cody Simon’s back and fell to the turf.\n\nFollowing a Buckeyes punt, Gabriel faked out nearly the entire Ohio State defense en route to a 27-yard rushing touchdown, giving the Ducks a 29-28 lead with 13:20 left, but Ohio State grabbed the lead back with a 40-yard field and six minutes remaining.\n\nDown to the 1-yard line and fourth-and-goal, Sappington put through a 19-yard chip shot to put Oregon up 32-31 with 1:47 left.\n\nOhio State looked to be on its way to a come-from-behind victory, driving with just over 90 seconds remaining, but its drive was stalled by an offensive pass interference call on Smith, followed by two incomplete passes and Howard’s game-ending slide.\n\n“This one’s gonna hurt, does hurt, should’ve won the game,” Day said. “Give Oregon credit. They played well but [there were] too many things we could’ve done better in this game that we didn’t. Got a lot of football ahead of us, and we gotta get those things fixed.”\n\nAfter taking a bye week, the Buckeyes will host the Nebraska Cornhuskers Oct. 26, with an official time still to be announced.",

      "content": "NCAA STAFF | OCTOBER 13, 2024\nNo. 3 Oregon beats No. 2 Ohio State, No. 4 Penn State survives USC, more from Week 7 of college football\n00:00\n/\n00:00\nHOW THE 12-TEAM COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF WORKS\nSHARE \n \n\nWeek 7 was highlighted by three overtime games with top-10 teams and an absolute thriller in Eugene between the two of the top three teams in the country. Needless to say, Oct. 12 lived up to all of the hype. Here is everything you need to know about Week 7 of college football.\n\nNo. 3 Oregon takes down No. 2 Ohio State 32-31\n\nOregon defeats Ohio State in its first ranked Big Ten matchup of the season, 32-31.\n\nThe Ducks secure their first-ever win over a top-2 ranked opponent — Oregon was 0-19 against top-2 opponents heading into this matchup. \n\nThe Buckeyes had the ball with under two minutes to play as Will Howard and company marched down the field in Oregon territory. The Kansas State transfer scrambled up the middle with under five seconds remaining, but Howard did not slide down in time for the Buckeyes to call a timeout. Had he gone down earlier, Ohio State would've certainly had an opportunity at a game-winning field goal attempt. \n\nIt was a shootout between veteran transfer quarterbacks Dillon Gabriel for Oregon and Howard. The two combined for over 650 passing yards and no interceptions in Eugene. \n\nEach team is loaded with star power, and both quarterbacks took advantage of their elite wide receivers. Emeka Egbuka and true freshman Jeremiah Smith combined for 193 yards, 19 receptions and two touchdowns for Howard. On the other side, Texas A&M transfer Evan Stewart displayed his connection with Gabriel, hauling seven catches for 149 yards and a touchdown.\n\nThe touted Buckeye defense had only allowed double-digit points once all season entering this showdown. Granted, they had not faced the caliber of offense Oregon holds, but the Ducks were certainly prepared for this matchup. \n\nEach o-line delivered for their offenses, as there was only one sack and five tackles for loss between each team the entire night. This thriller featured seven lead changes as neither defense had an answer for the explosive offenses. \n\nOhio State (5-1, 2-1 Big Ten) takes its first loss of the season, and the Buckeyes will receive a bye week to prepare for the second half of the season. \n\nAs for Oregon (6-0, 3-0 Big Ten), it will travel to West Lafayette to take on a struggling Purdue team next week on the back of arguably the biggest win in Duck's history. \n\nDan Lanning's squad showed up in one of the most anticipated matchups of the season, and Oregon is now the team to beat in the new-look Big Ten.  \n\nNo. 4 Penn State survives Southern California \n\nSpecial teams. Special plays. A special game. In a game that was decided by the legs of two kickers in overtime, No. 4 Penn State went to the West Coast and won a thriller against USC. \n\nSouthern California got the ball first in overtime, but kicker Michael Lantz missed a 45-yard field goal after the offense lost three yards on its overtime possession. That set up the Nittany Lions for a chance at a game-winning field goal. Penn State centered the ball between the uprights and kicker Ryan Barker's 36-yard field goal soared down the middle for the win.\n\nWith the win, coach James Franklin and crew move to 6-0 overall and 3-0 in the Big Ten. Tight end Tyler Warren was the star of the game. He set a PSU single-game record with 17 receptions, adding in 224 receiving yards (the second-most in school history) and a touchdown.\n\nOn the other sideline, USC head coach Lincoln Riley is only 5-8 in his last 13 games and has lost 9 of 13 games against ranked opponents since taking the job with the Trojans in 2022.\n\nNo. 8 Tennessee escapes Florida in OT\n\nTennessee narrowly escapes its second straight loss, defeating Florida 23-17 in OT at home.\n\nComing off a loss to Arkansas in Week 6, No. 8 Tennessee was challenged once again by an unranked SEC opponent. \n\nFlorida's defense smothered the Vols' explosive offense in the first half, holding Tennessee to just 130 total yards at the break. The Gators swarmed Tennessee quarterback Nico Iamaleava, tallying three sacks and picking off the redshirt freshman in the first 30 minutes. \n\nThe Gators (3-3, 1-2 SEC) put together a nine-play, 92-yard drive early in the third quarter, taking a 10-0 lead. But the Vols finally found their rhythm offensively, responding quickly with seven of their own. \n\nFlorida quarterback Graham Mertz exited the game midway through the third with a leg injury, leaving the Gator's offense in the hands of true freshman DJ Lagway. \n\nLagway struggled in his first few drives, throwing a pick and turning the ball over on downs. However, Lagway, down 17-10 with under a minute to play in regulation, threw a 30-yard dart over the middle to force OT in Knoxville. \n\nThe Volunteer's defense came through in overtime, knocking the Gators back four yards, and forcing a 47-yard field goal to open the extra period. The kick narrowly missed outside the right post, and Iamaleava marched the Vols 25 yards in five plays for the win. \n\nTennessee (5-1, 2-1 SEC) avoids a collapse and remains in the hunt for the SEC. The Vols will host Alabama next week, as each team will look to build some momentum after close wins in Week 7. \n\nNo. 13 LSU outlasts No. 9 Ole Miss in OT\n\nIn the third ranked overtime game of a wild Week 7, LSU stunned Ole Miss, 29-26, in Baton Rouge. \n\nOle Miss drops its second SEC game in three weeks, as LSU remains undefeated in conference play. \n\nThe Rebels held the lead the entire game until LSU quarterback Garrett Nussmeier tied it up 23-23 with 27 seconds in regulation.\n\nThe Tigers' defense stepped up in overtime, holding Ole Miss to a field goal. And it only took one play for LSU to secure the comeback win as Nussmeier connected with Kyren Lacy for the game-winning, 25-yard touchdown pass. \n\nWith a combination of a hostile crowd and suffocating pass rush, the LSU defense stepped up in a big way, sacking Heisman-hopeful Jaxson Dart six times tonight. The Tigers front seven kept LSU in the ball game after trailing 17-7 late in the first half. \n\nIt was a bend but don't break mentality for LSU's defense as the Rebels were held to two short field goals in the second half. Ole Miss let the Tigers hang around just long enough to claw back into the game, and by the time overtime came around, Brian Kelly's team held all of the momentum in front of their rowdy home crowd. \n\nOle Miss (5-2, 1-2 SEC), the preseason sixth-ranked team, drops below .500 in an uber-competitive SEC, and Lane Kiffin's squad will likely have to win out to have a chance at a postseason berth. \n\nLSU (5-1, 2-0 SEC) picks up its biggest win of the season, and the Tigers are now just one of three SEC teams undefeated in conference play. \n\nSCORES: See every score from Week 7 of college football\n\nNo. 1 Texas rolls No. 18 Oklahoma\n\nNo. 1 Texas dominated No. 18 Oklahoma in the Red River Rivalry with 34-3 blowout win. \n\nCapped off by coach Steve Sarkisian placing the Golden Hat trophy on quarterback Quinn Ewers head, the Longhorns improve to 6-0 for the first time since 2009.\n\nOklahoma made things interesting early, intercepting Ewers, who missed the last two games with an abdominal strain injury, on the game's first possession. Although OU didn't score, they kicked a field goal two drives later for the game's first points — the first time Texas trailed all season.\n\nHowever, that's when the Longhorns took over. \n\nTaking advantage of the Sooners' offensive struggles all season, the defense forced back-to-back fumbles near the end of the second quarter that translated to two touchdowns. This included running back Quintrevion Wisner’s fumble inches away from the end zone that wide receiver Silas Bolden scooped up for a touchdown.\n\nTexas went on to score 34 unanswered points. Ewers went 20-of-29 with 199 passing yards along with two touchdowns and an interception. Behind true freshman quarterback Michael Hawkins Jr., OU's offense finished with just 237 total yards, compared to Texas' 406.\n\nThe 31-point loss was Oklahoma's biggest since 2022 when they were shut out by Texas 49-0. The Longhorns return home next week for its biggest matchup of the season against No. 5 Georgia.\n\nMORE: No. 1 Texas blows out No. 18 Oklahoma in Red River Rivalry, wins 34-3\n\nNo. 7 Alabama holds off South Carolina\n\nAlabama outlasted South Carolina, 27-25, in a thrilling battle at Bryant-Denny Stadium.\n\nThe Crimson Tide (5-1 overall, 2-1 SEC) initially took control with a 14-0 lead thanks to a pair of touchdowns, including a short run by Jalen Milroe. However, South Carolina fought back, narrowing the gap with a 36-yard touchdown pass from LaNorris Sellers to help cut it to only 14-12 at the half.\n\nThe Gamecocks took a 19-14 lead in the third quarter, but Milroe responded with a 7-yard touchdown run to reclaim the lead for Alabama. A 34-yard touchdown pass to Germie Bernard extended the lead to 27-19. South Carolina scored again with less than a minute to play, though the Gamecocks failed on a two-point conversion attempt that would have tied the game.\n\nBut South Carolina (3-3, 1-3) had one final chance, as the Gamecocks recovered an onside kick. But Alabama's defense held strong in the final moments with an interception that sealed the win and prevented back-to-back losses.\n\nThe win marked a pivotal one for Alabama, as a loss would have been the program's first in back-to-back regular season games since 2007.\n\nSTREAKING: College football's longest active regular season win streaks\n\nArizona State takes down No. 16 Utah\n\nThe first ranked team to fall this weekend came on Friday night as Arizona State took down No. 16 Utah, 27-19. How big of an upset was this game you ask? Utah opened as the preseason Big 12 favorite. Arizona State was picked to finish last. \n\nNone of that mattered on the field, though, especially not to running back Cam Skattebo. The Arizona State running back ran for 158 yards and two touchdowns, both coming in the second half as explosive plays. Skattebo's 50-yard touchdown put the Sun Devils up 20-16 in the third quarter and his 47-yard touchdown secured the game with 2:41 to play in the game.\n\nThe win pushed Arizona State to 5-1 overall and 2-1 in the Big 12, with Utah dropping to 4-2 (1-2).\n\n🏈 LATEST COLLEGE FOOTBALL NEWS 🏈\n\n👀 FOLLOW: Scoreboard | TV schedule | Every poll, explained\n📈 AP POLL: AP Top 25 Poll | AP Poll accuracy \n🎟️ CFP: CFP rankings | CFP schedule | 12-team format, explained\n🏆 HEISMAN: 2024 contenders | Trophy winners | Teams with most winners  \n💯 MORE: College GameDay locations | Winningest teams | Coaches with most titles\n \nPrevious\nAlabama falls, Big Ten teams stack top four of Week 7's AP poll\nThe AP Top 25 Poll has a new look after four top-10 teams lost — including the No. 1 team — and seven ranked teams lost in total in a wild start to an October of college football.\nREAD MORE\n2024 Alabama football schedule: Dates, times, TV channels, scores\nCheck out the 2024 Alabama Crimson Tide's football schedule.

      "content": "Ohio State football falls short, loses at Oregon 32-31\nBILL RABINOWITZ   Columbus Dispatch\n\nEUGENE, Ore. – Ohio State's top-ranked defense was a mirage.\n\nThe Buckeyes were exposed by Oregon Saturday night.\n\nIn a matchup of the No. 2 Buckeyes against the No. 3 Ducks that lived up to its billing, OSU's defense didn't, leading to a 32-31 loss in front of an ear-splitting Autzen Stadium-record crowd of 60,129.\n\n\"This one's going to hurt,\" Ohio State coach Ryan Day said. \"It does hurt. We should have won the game. Give Oregon credit. They played well. But there were too many things we could have done better in this game that we didn't. We've got a lot of football ahead of us and we've got to get those things fixed.\"\n\nOhio State had taken the lead with 6 minutes left on a 40-yard field goal by Jayden Fielding. But its defense couldn't hold on.\n\nOregon drove 74 yards for the game-winning 19-yard field goal by Atticus Sappington with 1:47 left.\n\nOhio State (5-1, 2-1 Big Ten) entered the game allowing only 196.5 yards per game, the stingiest in the country. The Ducks (6-0, 3-0) gained 496 yards against the Buckeyes, who did not have a sack or force a turnover.\n\nDillon Gabriel completed 23 of 34 passes for 341 yards. Evan Stewart caught seven passes for 149 yards and a touchdown as he burned cornerback Denzel Burke repeatedly.\n\n\"We didn't make enough plays,\" defensive coordinator Jim Knowles said. \"I don't think we were outstanding in any area. It felt like we were always behind. It was uncharacteristic.\n\n\"We've got to learn from it. We've got to practice better and we've got to coach better. Our players are certainly good enough to win that game. We talked about winning the game on defense and we didn't get the job done.\"\n\nThe loss isn't as devastating as it might have been in the old four-team College Football Playoff format, but it does add to the pressure the Buckeyes face the rest of the year.\n\n\"I hope it lights a little fire under us,\" Howard said, \"because I still have got all the belief in the world in this team. (Oregon) is a good football team. I don't think they necessarily beat us. I think we beat ourselves a little bit.\"\n\nThe Buckeyes did have one final chance\n\nAfter a sack on first down, Carnell Tate made a grab for 13 yards. Emeka Egbuka followed that up with an 8-yard reception. After a 9-yard catch by Jeremiah Smith, Howard threw again to Egbuka, this time in tight coverage, for 26 yards to the Oregon 28.\n\nSmith then caught a 9-yard pass, but pushed off on the Oregon defender and was called for offensive pass interference that pushed the ball back to the 43.\n\n\"That cost us,\" Day said, \"but it shouldn't have come down to one play. I've said that before. We want to leave doubt and I feel we should have done that tonight and we did not.\"\n\nAfter an incompletion, the Buckeyes faced third-and-25. A penalty on Oregon moved the ball to the 38 with 6 seconds left. Needing a miracle, the Buckeyes didn't get it. Howard couldn't find an open receiver and took off running. Believing he had more time than he did, he slid down at the 26 as time expired.\n\nOhio State led twice in the second half after trailing 22-21 at halftime\n\nHoward threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Jeremiah Smith on the Buckeyes' first possession of the second half.\n\nThe Buckeyes then had a goal-line stand, forcing a Gabriel incompletion on fourth-and-2, to preserve the lead. But it didn't last. On the Ducks' next drive, Gabriel faked OSU's defense for a 27-yard touchdown to put Oregon ahead.\n\nGreat start, then a fizzle in a wacky first half\n\nOhio State got the ball first and drove 75 yards in 10 plays for a touchdown. If the Buckeyes hoped that would portend the way the rest of the first half would go, they were mistaken. Oregon took advantage of an Ohio State turnover and picked on Burke to take the halftime lead.\n\nLinebacker Derrick Harmon ripped the ball from OSU running back Quinshon Judkins at the Buckeyes' 28-yard line to set up Oregon's first touchdown, though the extra point failed after a bad snap.\n\nOhio State running back TreVeyon Henderson broke a 53-yard run to set up a touchdown to push the lead to 14-6.\n\nBut Ducks receiver Evan Stewart got behind Burke for a 69-yard gain and then made a terrific catch in the end zone against Burke for a score to make it 14-12.\n\nOn the play, OSU cornerback Jordan Hancock was called for a face mask. Oregon's subsequent kickoff from midfield was a line drive that bounced off OSU's Caleb Downs, and the Ducks recovered at the Buckeyes' 41.\n\nOregon had to settle for a field goal to take the lead after a 15-yard penalty on receiver Traeshon Holden, who was ejected for spitting on OSU cornerback Davison Igbinosun.\n\nThe Buckeyes answered with a long drive capped by a 15-yard pass from Howard to Egbuka to regain the lead.\n\nBut again, the Ducks picked on Burke. Tez Johnson beat him for a 48-yard touchdown that put Oregon ahead again.\n\nOhio State entered the game allowing only 196.5 yards per game, the stingiest in the country. The Ducks gained 285 in the first two quarters.\n\nOffensive line hobbled\n\nThe Buckeyes lost offensive linemen Josh Simmons and Tegra Tshabola to injuries in the first half. Austin Siereveld replaced Tshabola at right guard. Zen Michalski took over for Simmons, who was carted off in the second quarter with an apparent knee injury.\n\nSimmons has been perhaps the Buckeyes' most improved player, but Day said his season might have come to an end.\n\nGet more Ohio State football news by listening to our podcasts.\n \n \n ",

      "content": "Kansas State football vs Colorado recap: Wildcats rally for 31-28 victory\nARNE GREEN   Topeka Capital-Journal\n\nKansas State football came up big when it counted most, getting a quick touchdown to regain the lead with just over two minutes left and then making a stop on defense to claim a thrilling 31-28 victory over Colorado Saturday night at Folsom Field in Boulder.\n\nQuarterback Avery Johnson, whose fourth-quarter interception allowed Colorado go grab its first lead with 3:12 left, came right back to engineer the winning drive by hitting DJ Giddens with a 34-yard completion and then finding Jayce Brown for a 50-yard score with 2:14 left.\n\nThe Wildcat defense then forced Colorado to turn the ball over on downs and all that was left was for Johnson to run it out in victory formation.\n\nNo. 19-ranked K-State improved to 5-1 overall and 2-1 in the Big 12, while Colorado fell to 4-2 and 2-1.\n\nK-State had 423 yards of total offense with Johnson completing 15 of 23 passes for 224 yards and two touchdowns, and Giddens ran for 182 yards on 25 carries. Colorado had 359 total yards as Shedeur Sanders completed 34 of 40 passes for 388 yard, but the Buffs were minus-29 yards rushing, thanks in part to six K-State sacks.\n\nWatch Kansas State football vs Colorado live on Fubo (free trial)\n\nRelated: Kansas State football's defense laser focused on Shedeur Sanders and Colorado passing game\n\nRelated: Don't expect drama when Kansas State football's Dylan Edwards faces Colorado, Coach Prime\n\nFINAL: Kansas State 31, Colorado 28\n\nK-State escapes with a huge win in Boulder.\n\nK-State defense stops CU on downs\n\nOn fourth down, K-State cornerback Keenan Garber breaks up a Shedeur Sanders pass and the Wildcats take over with 1:14 left.

Cornerback Justice James, cornerback Keenan Garber, free safety Marques Sigle and cornerback Jacob Parrish all went down.\n\nAvery Johnson returns from injury to finish scoring drive\n\nKansas State quarterback Avery Johnson went to the locker room after appearing to hurt his hip while completing a 33-yard pass to Jayce Brown with 12:59 left in the third quarter.\n\nTa'Quan Roberson came on and directed the Wildcats to inside the 1-yard line before Johnson returned to hit Brown again for the 1-yard touchdown to give K-State a 21-7 lead with 6:55 left in the third quarter. The drive covered 81 yards in 16 plays and took 7:58 off the clock before Colorado touched the ball in the half.\n\nColorado star Travis Hunter injury update\n\nAccording to ESPN's sideline reporter, Colorado star wide receiver and cornerback Travis Hunter is questionable for the second half. He left for the locker room with an undisclosed injury with over 5 minutes left in the half.\n\nHALFTIME: Kansas State 14, Colorado 7\n\nKansas State's defense snuffs out a Colorado drive with a sack by Des Purnell and forcing an intentional grounding penalry.

Big drive for backs DJ Giddens and Dylan Edwards.\n\nColorado strikes first to lead 7-0\n\nAfter a short K-State punt, Colorado drives 49 yards in nine plays to take the lead on Shedeur Sanders' 25-yard completion to LaJontay Wester. The PAT is good and the Buffaloes lead 7-0 with 7:06 left in the first quarter.\n\nBoth teams shut down on first possession\n\nAfter getting a defensive stop, penalties set K-State back and Colorado has the ball back in Wildcat territory with 11:08 left in the first.\n\nColorado will get the ball first\n\nKansas State wins the coin toss and defers.

Two plays later, CU quarterback Shedeur Sanders threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to LaJohntay Wester to give Colorado a 28-24 lead with just 3:12 remaining.\n\n\"The defense came up with the play when they needed to come up with the play,\" Coach Prime said. \"You know we're going to score with the ball in Shedeur's hands down there and we went on and did what we had to do.\"\n\nBut CU fans barely had time to celebrate before Kansas State answered by going 84 yards in just three plays. The Wildcats had a 34-yard Avery Johnson pass to running back DJ Giddens to get to midfield, then saw Johnson throw a 50-yard touchdown pass to Jayce Brown to regain the lead, 31-28, with just 2:14 remaining.\n\n\"We didn't expect them to have a couple of explosion plays to set them up for a touchdown,\" Coach Prime said. \"We didn't even fathom that.\"\n\nStill, that left Colorado with one more chance. The Buffs took possession with 2:14 to play on their own 25, but a fourth-and-5 pass fell incomplete as CU's protestations for a pass interference call went unanswered.\n\nK-State then ran out the clock for the win.\n\nThe Buffs were without their two top receivers, Hunter and Jimmy Horn Jr., for the entire second half. Still, Sanders finished 34-for-40 for 388 yards and three touchdowns. Omarion Miller had eight catches for 145 yards, Will Sheppard had five for 83 and a touchdown and Wester caught five for 58 yards and two scores.\n\n\"Certainly losing Travis and Jimmy and others was tremendous, because they're a vital part of our team, a part of our identity,\" Coach Prime said. \"That took a lot out of us. But other guys had the opportunity to step up, and they did. So I'm proud of them.\"\n\nKansas State, though, had 423 yards total offense, 185 on the ground and 238 in the air. Giddens became the first player to surpass the 100-yard mark against Colorado this year, finishing with 182 yards on 25 carries, while Brown became the first receiver with 100 yards against CU with six catches for 121 yards and two scores.\n\n\"The goal was to try to stop the run and we didn't do that whatsoever,\" Sanders said. \"They had 224 yards rushing (not counting yards lost on sacks), and they ultimately dominated the time of possession. That's not good, because now we can't get on the field and do what we're capable of doing … We didn't tackle well today and we didn't get to the ball as a unit today.\"\n\nThe Wildcats also registered six sacks on CU's Sanders, leaving Colorado with a minus-29 yards rushing but the Buffs did collect four sacks of KSU's Johnson.\n\nEven without the 74 yards lost on sacks, CU's rushing game produced just 45 yards with a 13-yard Sanders run the longest of the night. \n\n\"The play calls are there, we didn't execute,\" Coach Prime said. \"We missed a block here, we missed this there, we missed this there. We just didn't execute.\"\n\nBut while the Buffs are still in decent position to contend for a Big 12 championship game bid, they know this was an opportunity that slipped through their fingers.\n\n\"Sometimes you get your butt kicked, you just gotta take it,\" Sanders said. \"But sometimes you lose, you say, 'Dang, we should've won that. We should've had that.' And that was one of those types of games. That's not taking anything away from our opponents, because they played their butts off, and they're in that locker room right now celebrating, having a good time, and they deserve it. But for us, we just felt like we let that one slip away. We got to do a better job of taking advantage of the opportunities that we had to win that game, because we had several.\"\n\nHOW IT HAPPENED: Colorado struck first, getting good field position after a short K-State punt gave CU the ball at the KSU 49-yard line.\n\nThe Buffs used nine plays to reach the end zone. Colorado kept the drive alive on fourth-and-7 when Sanders hit Wester for an 8-yard gain. Three plays later, Sanders and Wester connected again on a 25-yard scoring pass and Colorado took a 7-0 lead.\n\nThe Wildcats answered with their first scoring drive of the night on their next possession. Quarterback Avery Johnson directed an 11-play, 75-yard scoring march, capping the drive with an 8-yard touchdown run on fourth-and-4 to knot the score at 7-7.\n\nColorado's offense couldn't find its rhythm again the rest of the half. After both teams traded punts, K-State methodically drove 60 yards in eight plays for a go-ahead touchdown. Giddens ran six times for 50 yards before former Buff Dylan Edwards finished the drive with a 1-yard scoring run to give KSU a 14-7 lead with 1:52 left in the half.\n\n\"He (Giddens) is phenomenal,\" Coach Prime said. \"He's one of the best in the country. I mean, his maneuverability is unbelievable.\"\n\nBut that left Colorado with enough time to put together a drive and the Buffs started off well, getting two quick pass completions to reach the Kansas State 34-yard line.\n\nBut Sanders was sacked on first and third down for a total of 19 yards in losses to end the half and send the Buffs into the locker room at the break trailing 14-7.\n\nKansas State took the opening kick of the second half and methodically drove 81 yards in 16 plays for a touchdown. The Wildcats converted a third-and-11 to keep the drive alive early, then gained 14 yards on third-and-7 to reach the CU 11-yard line.\n\nColorado then held to put the 'Cats in a fourth-and-1, but KSU converted and then scored two plays later on a 1-yard scoring pass to take a 21-7 lead with 6:55 to play in the third quarter.\n\nBut the Buffs offense finally found some consistency on the ensuing possession. CU drove 75 yards for a touchdown, with Sanders completing six of seven passes for all 75 yards. Colorado's Sheppard, who had a drop for the only incompletion on the drive, atoned for the miscue by hauling in a 7-yard scoring pass from Sanders and CU cut the K-State lead to 21-14 with 4:44 to play in the third quarter.\n\nKansas State returned the ensuing kick to the KSU 43-yard line and quickly reached into CU territory. The Buffs defense then held but the Wildcats managed to reap a 48-yard field goal to take a 24-14 lead with 28 seconds remaining in the third quarter.\n\nColorado then saw a promising drive end on a rare mistake from Sanders, who overthrew a receiver deep in KSU territory, resulting in an interception. But the Buffs defense rose to the occasion, forcing a K-State 3-and-out, and CU took over again on its own 28 after a Kansas State punt.\n\n The Buffs made their next possession count. Sanders completed seven passes on a 72-yard scoring drive, including a 14-yard toss to Wester on fourth-and-3. Isaiah Augustave then finished the march with a 2-yard scoring run to pull CU to within 24-21 with 6:44 to play.\n\nColorado's defense then came up with a huge play. After K-State drove inside CU territory, Hood plucked a deflected pass out of the air and returned it 59 yards to the K-State 17-yard line.\n\nCU needed just two plays to score, with Sanders and Wester hooking up for their second touchdown of the night, an 11-yarder that gave Colorado a 28-24 lead.\n\nBut the Wildcats answered in a hurry. KSU needed just three plays to go 84 yards, getting a 50-yard touchdown pass from Johnston to Jayce Brown to regain the lead, 31-28.\n\nThat gave the Buffs the ball back on their own 25 with 2:14 on the clock.\n\nCU's last possession, though, ended with an incompletion on fourth-and-5, handing the ball back to the Wildcats, who then ran out the clock by taking a knee and three straight plays.\n\nTURNING POINT: This one wasn't decided until the final minutes. After Colorado took a 28-24 lead late in the game, the Buffs gave up two huge explosion plays — a 34-yard pass to get KSU to midfield, then a 50-yard touchdown pass.\n\nKEY STATISTIC: Colorado gave up 185 yards rushing (224 without counting sack yardage), by far the most against CU this season … The Buffs were just 4-for-11 on third downs … The Buffs gave up 13 explosion plays — passes of at least 15 yards and runs of at least 10 — for 283 yards.\n\nWHAT IT MEANS: The Buffs are no longer tied for the Big 12 lead, but they are just one game behind the three leaders with six games still to play.\n\nNEXT UP: The Buffs hit the road next Saturday for a 2 p.m. (MT) game at Arizona (FOX). \n\nRead More\nRelated News\nAll News\nBuffs Vs.

Colorado boasts arguably the best QB in college football and a Heisman Trophy frontrunner, but Kansas State might be the most complete team in the conference at this point despite the Buffs' major improvements.\n\nThe Wildcats' rushing attack, even if slowed down a bit, could limit Colorado's offensive opportunities and shorten the game. The Buffs have also struggled containing mobile QBs this season dating back to the season opener vs. NDSU (where Klieman coached before taking over at Kansas State).\n\nSaturday's game could play out similarly to how Colorado's Week 1 win (31-26) over the Bison did. The Wildcats, unlike NDSU, actually have the talent to compete with the Buffs' stars.\n\nKansas State wins 37-35.\n\nMore: Colorado football vs Kansas State scouting report: Prediction and 3 keys for Week 7 game\n\n-- Scott Procter\n\nWhat's the betting line for Colorado vs Kansas State football?\n\nKansas State is a 3.5-point favorite to defeat Colorado, according to the BetMGM college football odds, as of Saturday afternoon.\n\nColorado vs Kansas State injury updates\n\nColorado will have its entire starting defense back for Kansas State, Deion Sanders said Tuesday.\n\nThat group includes starting safety Shilo Sanders, who has been out of the lineup since Week 2 when he suffered a forearm injury that required surgery.\n\n\"Shilo is ready,\" Deion Sanders said Tuesday. \"He's practicing, he's full go, has a rubber cast on, he's doing his thing.

The Buffaloes are riding a three-game winning streak following their 48-21 win at UCF two weeks ago, and they are returning home for the first time in three weeks. K- State also had a bye last week after cruising to a 42-20 win over then-No. 20 Oklahoma State at the end of September. This is the first meeting between these former rivals since 2010, with Colorado holding a 45-20-1 edge in the all-time series.\n\nKickoff at Folsom Field in Boulder is at 10:15 p.m. ET. The latest Colorado vs. Kansas State odds via SportsLine consensus list the Wildcats as 3.5-point favorites, while the over/under is 55.5. Before entering any Kansas State vs. Colorado picks, you'll want to see the college football predictions from the advanced computer model at SportsLine.\n\nThe model simulates every FBS college football game 10,000 times. Since its inception, it has generated a profit of well over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college football spread picks since inception, and is 8-4 on top-rated picks over the past two weeks of this season.

Here are several college football betting lines for the game:\n\nColorado vs. Kansas State spread: Kansas State -3.5\nColorado vs. Kansas State over/under: 55.5 points\nColorado vs. Kansas State money line: Kansas State -163, Colorado +135\nColorado vs. Kansas State picks: See picks here\nColorado vs. Kansas State streaming: FuboTV (Try for free)\nWhy Colorado can cover\n\nWhile Kansas State quarterback Avery Johnson is an emerging star, Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders is an established star. Sanders has completed 70% of his passes for 1,630 yards, 14 touchdowns and just three interceptions this season, which are nearly twice as strong as Johnson's numbers. Kansas State's defense gave up 342 passing yards to Tulane earlier this season, and it allowed 364 yards to the Cowboys its last time out.\n\nJunior wide receiver Travis Hunter has 46 receptions for 561 yards and six touchdowns while playing shut down defense as a cornerback. He is among the top Heisman Trophy contenders heading into Week 7, and he forms one of the best duos in the country alongside Sanders. Colorado has covered the spread in six of its last eight games as an underdog, with head coach Deion Sanders knowing what buttons to press to get his team motivated for this type of game. See which team to pick here. \n\nWhy Kansas State can cover\n\nKansas State is coming off its most impressive win of the season, cruising to a 22-point win over then-No. 20 Oklahoma State. Sophomore quarterback Avery Johnson completed 19 of 31 passes for 259 yards and three touchdowns while rushing for 60 yards and two more scores. Junior running back DJ Giddens was arguably just as impressive in that game, rushing 15 times for 187 yards and a score.\n\nThe Wildcats are averaging the seventh-most rushing yards per game (252.2) nationally, and they are facing a Colorado defense that is allowing the fourth-most yards per game (379.6) in the Big 12. Colorado's win over UCF does not look as impressive after the Knights lost to Florida by two scores last week. Kansas State has covered the spread in 10 of its last 14 Big 12 games, while Colorado is 3-15 in its last 18 October games. See which team to pick here. \n\nHow to make Colorado vs. Kansas State picks\n\nThe model has simulated Kansas State vs. Colorado 10,000 times and the results are in.

      "content": "Colorado's Travis Hunter exits game with injury vs. Kansas State\nBuffaloes two-way star walked to the locker room after shoulder pain\nJason Jones | 8 Hours Ago\nKris Miller/SI\nIn this story:\nColorado Buffaloes\n\nColorado Buffaloes' two-way star Travis Hunter exited the game against No. 18 Kansas State after suffering a shoulder injury late in the first half. The Heisman hopeful, who has been a vital part of Colorado’s success this season, left the field during a timeout with about six minutes remaining before halftime. This marked the longest period of time Hunter has been off the field this season, as his versatility as both a wide receiver and cornerback has been crucial to the Buffaloes.\n\n\nHunter, who was receiving attention from Colorado’s athletic training staff on the sideline, appeared in discomfort as they evaluated his shoulder. After a brief assessment on the field, he was escorted to the locker room for further evaluation, leaving Colorado fans holding their breath. His presence on the field has been a game-changer for the Buffaloes throughout the season, making his exit a significant moment in the contest.\n\nDeion Sanders calls out ESPN's Pat McAfee over not favoring Travis Hunter for Heisman\n\nAt the time of Hunter's departure, the game between Colorado and Kansas State was tied at 7-7, and the Buffaloes faced a tough challenge against a top-20 opponent. Losing Hunter's abilities on both sides of the ball could prove to be a major blow for Colorado, which has leaned on his playmaking ability in both defensive and offensive schemes.\n\n\nHunter’s injury and the timing of his exit will likely be a critical storyline as the game progresses. His return status remains uncertain, and Colorado will need to adjust without their standout player as they head into halftime tied with Kansas State in a hard-fought battle.\n\nThis story is developing.\n\n\n\n\nPublished 8 Hours Ago|Modified Oct 12, 2024\nJASON JONES",

      "content": "Colorado can't pull off another miracle after losing Travis Hunter, other stars to injury\nBRENT SCHROTENBOER   USA TODAY\nShow Caption\n\nBOULDER, Colo. – Coach Deion Sanders and his Colorado football team almost pulled off another miracle here Saturday night against Kansas State.\n\nJust three weeks after they needed a Hail Mary touchdown pass to beat Baylor, this time they overcame a 14-point deficit in the second half to retake the lead late in the fourth quarter. But big lapses on defense doomed them in the end of a 31-28 loss at Folsom Field.\n\nThe loss stops a three-game winning streak that had the Buffaloes gunning for the Big 12 title. The question now is how bad the fallout will be, because they didn’t just lose the game.\n\nThey also lost two-way star Travis Hunter, who left the game in the second quarter with a shoulder injury and didn’t return.\n\nHis future status is unclear, as is his promising candidacy for the Heisman Trophy.\n\nIn his absence, Kansas State hogged the ball and scored on their first three offensive possessions without Hunter on the field at cornerback – two touchdowns and a 48-yard field goal.\n\nThe Buffs still took the lead briefly late in the fourth quarter, 28-24. But they surrendered it right back with a defensive lapse at the end – a three-play, 84-yard touchdown drive that put the Wildcats up for good with 2:14 remaining, culminating with a 50-yard touchdown pass from KSU quarterback Avery Johnson to receiver Jayce Brown.\n\nKSU running back DJ Giddens rushed for 182 yards on 25 carries. Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders completed 34 of 40 passes for 388 yards and three touchdowns with one interception.\n\nColorado-Kansas State game marred by injuries\n\nThe loss means the Buffs finish the first half of the season with a 4-2 record, the same record they had at this point last year before finishing 4-8. But they’re still 2-1 in Big 12 Conference play heading into a road game next Saturday at Arizona (3-3).\n\nNo. 19 Kansas State improved to 5-1 in front of 53,972 at Folsom Field – a game that started shortly before 10:30 p.m. ET and was often marred by play stoppages because of player injuries. \n\nBy losing Hunter, Colorado essentially had to go without two of its best players – its best receiver and its best cornerback. Colorado’s other top receiver, Jimmy Horn Jr., also limped out of the game in the second quarter and didn’t return. Then in the fourth quarter, Colorado receiver Omarion Miller had to be helped off the field with an injury after reeling in a completion that gained 51 yards.\n\nColorado QB Shedeur Sanders then threw an interception on the very next play near the goal line when the Wildcats led 24-14. But he led the Buffs back on his next series, a 72-yard touchdown drive that cut KSU’s lead to 24-21 with 6:44 left.\n\nTravis Hunter’s replacement makes big play\n\nThe player who replaced Hunter at cornerback was Auburn transfer Colton Hood, who helped the Buffs take lead after that with a big play on fourth down. He intercepted a tipped pass from Kansas State quarterback Avery Johnson and nearly ran it back for a touchdown. Yet he couldn’t quite make it and ended up racing 59 yards to the Kansas State 17-yard line. The Buffaloes scored two plays later with a an 11-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Shedeur Sanders to receiver LaJohntay Wester.\n\nThat helped put the Buffs up 28-24 with 3:12 left. In response, Kansas State struck back and took the lead on that wild three-play drive that covered 84 yards to put the Wildcats up 31-28.\n\nTravis Hunter injured in first half vs. Kansas State\n\nThe Wildcats led 14-7 at halftime after Hunter came out of the game with a shoulder injury in the second quarter. The game was tied 7-7 when it happened and apparently came when Hunter took a helmet to the shoulder from Kansas State safety Daniel Cobbs on a 14-yard catch.\n\nKansas State then quickly took advantage of Hunter’s absence on defense by mounting a 60-yard touchdown drive to take a 14-7 lead with 1:52 left in the first half. The Wildcats then scored again on their next possession after halftime, stretching their lead to 21-7 with Hunter still sidelined with the injury.\n\nOn the latter drive, Kansas State chewed up 7:58 of game clock and went 81 yards on 16 plays, capped by a 1-yard touchdown pass from Johnson to Brown.\n\nHunter finished with three catches for 26 yards and one tackle on defense before being replaced on defense by Auburn transfer Colton Hood. Hunter also threw a block on Colorado’s only touchdown of the first half – a 25-yard catch by fellow receiver LaJohntay Wester in the first quarter.\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

They’d go into the break down 14-7.\n\nVanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia was 9/11 and tossed two scores in the first half.\n\nThe Commodores would take advantage of Kentucky’s lack of execution and control most the second half.\n\nUK never really had in a chance in this one simply because they couldn’t get out of their own way.\n\nVandy makes it two in a row in Lexington. The Cats are now 2-10 in the week following ir last 12 SEC home games.\n\nUnacceptable.\n\nHere are four things to know from Kentucky’s third loss of the season.\n\nDiego Pavia can play\n\nFollowing up his monster performance against Alabama, Pavia would throw for 143 yards and two scores. He led a 97-yard drive to start the game and really flexed his ability to keep the defense off-balance.\n\nThen, he ended the second half with another brilliant stretch to give the Dores a 14-7 lead heading into the break.\n\nAfter an awkward takedown in the third quarter, Pavia would leave the game and return in a knee brace. His gritty performance was impressive.\n\nWhen Pavia is cooking, there’s not much opposing defense can do to stop him.\n\nSaying that, Kentucky’s defense did enough to win this game. The offense was just woefully inefficient, and Pavia did just enough for the Dores to squeak out the win.\n\nDane Key continues to shine\n\n#6 once again showed why he’s going to be playing on Sundays. Key would grab eight receptions and scored a fourth-quarter touchdown that gave the Cats some life.\n\nIt’s been solidified that Dane Key is the most consistent option for this Kentucky offense that continues to sputter.\n\nAt this pace, Key may hear his name called at some point in the 2025 NFL Draft if he opts to leave.\n\nUndisciplined play\n\nKentucky couldn’t get out of its own way in the first half racking up eight penalties for 71 yards, including several in critical situations.\n\nThe second half produced much of the same.\n\nLate in the third quarter a botched snap would cost the Cats three points. After a Dane touchdown the special teams unit failed to convert an extra point.\n\nSpecial teams was a nightmare all night.\n\nKentucky would finish the night with 12 penalties for 106 yards.\n\nUndisciplined play begins to mount as a concern, especially when you consider that Mark Stoops’ team is coming off a bye week. Then again, his teams have consistently been awful coming out of byes. Somehow in Year 12, he still hasn’t figured out how to perform coming out of a bye.\n\nUK can be very frustrating to watch sometimes, and cleaning up the play has to be a primary focus moving forward.\n\nNext week the Cats will travel to one of the loudest environments in the country when they travel to the Swamp to take on the Florida Gators.\n\nA trip to the Swamp is up next\n\nKentucky will travel to Gainesville to take on the Florida Gators. Even though UK has had recent success, playing in the Swamp is never easy.\n\nIf the Cats can’t figure out how to execute and avoid penalties it’ll be a long night in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.\n\nFlorida will be chomping at the bit coming off a heartbreaking 23-17 OT loss to #8 Tennessee.\n\nNow, let’s discuss this one.\n\nIN THIS STREAM\nKentucky vs. Vanderbilt 2024: What to know for Week 7\nSunday Headlines: On to Florida after embarrassing loss to Vanderbilt\nKentucky falls to Vanderbilt: 4 things to know and postgame banter\nKentucky vs. Vanderbilt game thread and pregame reading\nVIEW ALL 16 STORIES\nMORE FROM A SEA OF BLUE\nSunday Headlines: On to Florida after embarrassing loss to Vanderbilt\nVanderbilt players stomp on Kentucky logo after huge upset\nBox score, MVP & Twitter reactions to another epic blunder by Mark Stoops\nKentucky vs. Vanderbilt game thread and pregame reading\nSaturday Headlines: Vanderbilt Gameday Edition\n5 keys to victory vs. Vandy\nLoading comments...",

      "content": "Kentucky vs Vanderbilt score today: Results, highlights from Week 7 college football game\nRYAN BLACK ,  C.L. BROWN   Louisville Courier Journal\nShow Caption\n\nCoverage from the game:\n\nKentucky football's offense doesn't do enough in latest SEC loss against Vanderbilt\n\nBrown: Kentucky football's inept offense wasting Brad White's championship-level defense\n\nCoverage during the game:\n\nLEXINGTON — Rarely does a matchup between the Kentucky and Vanderbilt football programs garner nationwide attention. Such is life as two schools that have routinely duked it out at the bottom of the SEC standings. Entering the 2024 campaign, the Wildcats and Commodores ranked 13th and 14th, respectively, in all-time winning percentage in conference regular-season games; UK was 190-407-12 (.322); Vandy was 140-457-18 (.242). Those were the worst two percentages among active league members through the 2023 campaign, prior to this fall's additions of Oklahoma and Texas.\n\nBut thanks to Kentucky and Vandy's most recent outings, Saturday night's meeting between the pair has some national cachet.\n\nUK ended then-No. 5 Ole Miss' unbeaten season Sept. 28, going on the road and knocking off the Rebels, 20-17, in Mark Stoops' signature win at Kentucky. And then last week, Vanderbilt earned its first victory over a top-five squad in program history, stunning Alabama at home, 40-35.\n\nWatch Kentucky football vs Vanderbilt live on Fubo (free trial)\n\nKentucky's offense has started to find its footing, with quarterback Brock Vandagriff throwing for 243 yards and a touchdown on 18-of-28 passing (64.3%) against Ole Miss. In the past two games, he's found a new favorite target: receiver Dane Key has 15 receptions for 250 receiving yards in that span.\n\nVanderbilt has a star signal caller of its own in Diego Pavia. The New Mexico State transfer is coming off the game of a lifetime, accounting for 308 yards (252 passing, 56 rushing) and throwing two TD passes in the upset of Alabama.\n\nSaturday's victorious team will move to 4-2 this fall, taking another step toward bowl eligibility.\n\nWe find out which squad that will be Saturday night, when the Wildcats and Commodores tee it up under the lights at Kroger Field.\n\nKentucky vs Vanderbilt score updates\nFINAL: VANDERBILT 20, KENTUCKY 13\nVANDERBILT 20, KENTUCKY 13 (4Q, 7:02)\n\nKentucky quarterback Brock Vandagriff connects with receiver Dane Key on a 22-yard scoring strike. UK fails to attempt an extra point, however, as the snap was low. Vanderbilt's lead stands at seven points.\n\nVANDERBILT 20, KENTUCKY 7 (4Q, 8:47)\n\nVandy kicker Brock Taylor extends the visitors' lead to 13 thanks to a 50-yard field goal.\n\nVANDERBILT 17, KENTUCKY 7 (3Q, 7:51)\n\nThe Commodores took a 10-point lead thanks to a 49-yard field goal by Brock Taylor. The drive was kept alive when Vandy quarterback Diego Pavia was ruled to have his knee down before he fumbled. UK challenged the call to no avail.\n\nHALFTIME: VANDERBILT 14, KENTUCKY 7\nVANDERBILT 14, KENTUCKY 7 (2Q, 0:13)\n\nThe Commodores put together a quick scoring drive, traversing 60 yards in six plays. The drive took just 1:22, capped by an 18-yard touchdown pass from Diego Pavia to Richie Hoskins.\n\nPlay stopped at 10:19 mark of second quarter for Vanderbilt Miles Capers injury\nKENTUCKY 7, VANDERBILT 7 (2Q, 14:50)\n\nDemie Sumo-Karngbaye scored on a 1-yard run to cap off a 12-play, 78-yard drive for the Cats.\n\nVANDERBILT 7, KENTUCKY 0 (1Q, 4:50)\n\nThe visitors have no issue moving on the ball on their first possession, driving 97 yards in eight plays for the game's opening score. Quarterback Diego Pavia connected with running back AJ Newberry for a 20-yard score.\n\nFinal player availability report released for Kentucky vs Vanderbilt game\n\nThe final availability report for Saturday's game was released 90 minutes prior to kickoff.\n\nSeven players are out for Kentucky:\n\nDB Maxwell Hairston\nRB Chip Trayanum\nDB Terhyon Nichols\nDL Darrion Henry-Young\nK Jacob Kauwe\nDL Tavion Gadson\nDL Josaih Hayes\n\nKentucky's four players listed as \"probable\" Friday night are cleared to play Saturday: Quarterback Brock Vandagriff, wide receiver Hardley Gilmore IV, offensive lineman Courtland Ford and defensive lineman Keeshawn Silver. If Gilmore or Ford take the field, it will make their first appearance this season.\n\nVanderbilt has four players sidelined Saturday.\n\nLB Langston Patterson\nDL Zaylin Wood\nCB Mark Davis\nOL Grayson Morgan\nKentucky vs Vanderbilt time today\nDate: Saturday, Oct. 12\nTime: 7:45 p.m.\nLocation: Kroger Field; Lexington\nWhat channel is Kentucky vs Vanderbilt game on today?\nTV channel: SEC Network\nStreaming: Fubo (free trial)\nRadio: UK Sports Network (840 AM in Louisville; 630 AM and 98.1 FM in Lexington)\n\nKentucky vs. Vanderbilt will be broadcast nationally on SEC Network.

Streaming options for the game include FUBO, which offers a free trial to new subscribers.\n\nUK vs Vandy history\nSeries record: Kentucky leads, 48-43-4 (The on-field record in the series is 49-43-2 in the Wildcats' favor, but they vacated a 2021 win because of NCAA violations.)\nKentucky's last win: 2023 (45-28)\nVanderbilt's last win: 2022 (24-21)\nKentucky vs Vanderbilt prediction\n\nKentucky 31, Vanderbilt 24: The Wildcats will be well rested after their first open date of the fall. The Commodores will be trying to get over the most monumental win in the history of the program. That favors UK. As does the fact its defense already has slowed down a pair of outstanding offenses in Georgia and Ole Miss. This one will be close — as most Kentucky/Vandy games in Lexington tend to be. (The past four matchups at Kroger Field have been decided by seven points or less.) But the Wildcats' defense will show up when it counts, picking off Commodores quarterback Diego Pavia for a game-clinching interception on the contest's final drive to improve to 4-2 on the season.\n\nKentucky vs Vanderbilt betting odds\n\nGame lines and odds from BetMGM as of today:\n\nSpread: Kentucky is a 12 ½-point home favorite\nOver/under: 44 ½\nMoneyline: Kentucky, -500; Vanderbilt, +375\nUK vs Vandy injury updates\n\nPer the SEC's latest availability report, posted at 8 p.m. Friday, Kentucky has seven players listed as \"out\" for Saturday's game.\n\nThat group includes:\n\nDB Maxwell Hairston\nRB Chip Trayanum\nDB Terhyon Nichols\nDL Darrion Henry-Young\nK Jacob Kauwe\nDL Tavion Gadson\nDL Josaih Hayes\n\nUK had four more players listed as probable: Quarterback Brock Vandagriff, wide receiver Hardley Gilmore IV, offensive lineman Courtland Ford and defensive lineman Keeshawn Silver. Neither Gilmore nor Ford have appeared in a game this season.\n\nVanderbilt has only three players listed as \"out.\"\n\nThat group includes:\n\nDL Zaylin Wood\nCB Mark Davis\nOL Grayson Morgan\n\nCommodores linebacker Langston Patterson is questionable. Five more Vandy players are designated as \"probable\" to play Saturday: safety CJ Taylor, linebacker Bryan Longwell, defensive lineman Yilanan Ouattara, edge Boubacar Diakite and offensive lineman Chase Mitchell.\n\nKentucky vs Vanderbilt weather update\n\nThe high is 79 degrees with cloudy skies and a 6% chance of rain in the forecast.\n\nKentucky football 2024 schedule\nAug. 31: Southern Miss ∣ SCORE: Kentucky 31, Southern Miss 0\nSept. 7: South Carolina ∣ SCORE: South Carolina 31, Kentucky 6\nSept. 14: Georgia ∣ SCORE: Georgia 13, Kentucky 12\nSept. 21: Ohio ∣ SCORE: Kentucky 41, Ohio 6\nSept. 28: at Ole Miss ∣ SCORE: Kentucky 20, Ole Miss 17\nOct. 12: Vanderbilt ∣ 7:45 p.m.\nOct. 19: at Florida ∣ 7:45 p.m.\nOct. 26: Auburn\nNov. 2: at Tennessee\nNov. 16: Murray State ∣ 1:30 p.m.\nNov. 23: at Texas\nNov. 30: Louisville\n\nRecord: 3-2 (1-2 SEC)\n\nBuy Kentucky football tickets this season with StubHub\n\nVanderbilt football 2024 schedule\nAug. 31: Virginia Tech ∣ SCORE: Vanderbilt 34, Virginia Tech 27 (OT)\nSept. 7: Alcorn State ∣ SCORE: Vanderbilt 55, Alcorn State 0\nSept. 14: at Georgia State ∣ SCORE: Georgia State 36, Vanderbilt 32\nSept. 21: at Missouri ∣ SCORE: Missouri 30, Vanderbilt 27 (2OT)\nOct. 5: Alabama ∣ SCORE: Vanderbilt 40, Alabama 35\nOct. 12: at Kentucky ∣ 7:45 p.m.\nOct. 19: Ball State ∣ 7 p.m.\nOct. 26: Texas\nNov. 2: at Auburn\nNov. 9: South Carolina\nNov. 23: at LSU\nNov. 30: Tennessee\n\nRecord: 3-2 (1-1 SEC)\n\nKentucky football news\nWhat is path to bowl eligibility for coach Mark Stoops, 2024 Wildcats?\nKentucky defense is where Heisman dreams go to die.

BROWN   Louisville Courier Journal\nShow Caption\n\nLEXINGTON — Kentucky’s defense plays at championship level.\n\nThe only teams better in the SEC in total yards allowed per game are Tennessee and Texas — and they’d both be in the College Football Playoff if the season ended today.\n\nThe Wildcats won’t be competing for anybody’s championship no matter when the season ends with an offense that can’t function against Power Four competition. UK will only be wasting away this defense on a team that will be as inconsistent as its offense.\n\nThere’ll be times like the 20-17 win at Ole Miss, where the Cats will muster just enough scoring drives on offense and Brad White's defense will take care of the rest to pull it through. But it seems there'll be more times like Saturday night's 20-13 loss to Vanderbilt, where the offense will sputter despite a defensive effort good enough to win a game.\n\nThree times makes a trend now. It happened in their 31-6 loss to South Carolina in the SEC opener. It happened in their 13-12 loss to Georgia.\n\n\"We have to play complementary football, we have to do things right to win games, no matter who you're playing,\" UK coach Mark Stoops said. \"I think you see that across this league, and very clearly that wasn't winning football with the penalties and the turnovers and missed assignments and basic stuff.\"\n\nFrustrating doesn't nearly cover how maddening it was to watch UK move the ball — it actually outgained the 'Dores 322-288 in total yards. But it still came up empty at the end of drives.\n\nKentucky ranks last in the SEC in scoring offense, averaging just 22 points per game — and that was before just scoring twice against Vandy. It all adds up to asking the defense to play as close to perfect as possible just to keep them in games.\n\nPenalties played a large role in ending the Cats' scoring opportunities. They had entered the game as the least-penalized team in the SEC with 28 penalties for 206 yards. They finished with 12 penalties for 106 yards against the Commodores.\n\nUK has only scored three points on its opening possession all season. But it seemed headed for a score as it reached the Vandy 37 on its first drive.\n\nA holding penalty knocked the Cats back to a first-and-20, but they had a doable third-and-2 on a Dane Key reception to the Vandy 29. But Key drew an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on the play when he tapped the defender on the helmet with the ball. That was too much to overcome, and the drive ended with a punt.\n\nThe Commodores defense ranked 13th in the conference, allowing 346 yards per game; and they were 15th in scoring defense, allowing an average of 25.6 points per game. The Cats couldn’t reach those numbers even if their score would have been boosted by a bad hold that cost them a field goal and a bad snap that botched an extra point.\n\nIn the second quarter, with the game tied at 7, UK linebacker D’Eryk Jackson tipped a Diego Pavia pass to himself intended for tight end Cole Spence and picked it off. It was the first time this season Pavia had been intercepted.\n\nHow did UK reward that effort? By twice giving the ball back to Vanderbilt.\n\nFormer Kentucky, Louisville basketball coach Rick Pitino on returning to Big Blue Madness in Lexington\nDuring the Kentucky football game Saturday, former Kentucky and Louisville basketball coach Rick Pitino talks returning to Lexington for the Big Blue Madness event.\n\nThe Cats got a do-over on the first time, when quarterback Brock Vandagriff tried to force a pass to Key and was intercepted by linebacker Bryce Cowan. The play was overturned by a video review when it was deemed Cowan didn’t control the ball to the ground. There was no such saving grace when Key caught a pass at the Vandy 25 but was stripped by cornerback Trudell Berry, and the fumble was recovered by Vandy’s Nick Rinaldi.\n\n\"As bad as we played,\" Stoops said, \"we still had opportunities.\"\n\nUK's defense prevented Vandy from being able to run out the clock to end the game, giving the offense one final drive to attempt to tie or take the lead.\n\nThe Cats reached the Vandy 48 before proceeding backward. A holding penalty on first down was followed by a holding penalty on third down. Facing a third-and-32, they took themselves out of contention.\n\n\"I don't know, if I could point it to any one thing, just lack of execution in critical moments,\" said Stoops, of their inability to finish drives.\n\nThere was a lack of execution in the basic moments, too, that's the problem with this offense. As stellar as the Cats defense is, they can't always make up for it, so they're sure to have more games like Saturday.\n\nReach sports columnist C.L.

Through the air, Pavia has thrown for 973 yards, which is good for 10th in the SEC. Pavia has thrown eight touchdowns and has yet to throw a pick on the year thus far.\n\nHowever, this is not it for Pavia, as he also leads the Commodores and is seventh in the SEC with 335 rushing yards. Pavia has also rushed for two touchdowns. \n\nMoving over to the actual running back position, Demie Sumo-Karngbaye leads the Wildcats’ backfield into this week seven game with 321 yards on the ground, which is good for ninth in the SEC. Sumo-Karngbaye has found the end zone three times this season. \n\nOutside of Pavia, Sedrick Alexander is the lead back for Vandy with 281 yards on the ground, which places him 16th in the SEC. Alexander has rushed for five touchdowns this season. \n\nTaking a look at the leading receiver for each team, Dane Key has been on a roll for the home Cats, posting back-to-back 100 yard performances.

Key has hauled in one touchdown this season. \n\nAs for the visiting Commodores, Eli Stowers leads the team with 333 receiving yards, which is 14th in the SEC. Stowers has hauled in one touchdown so far this season.\n\nTaking a look at the offenses as a whole, the Wildcats have averaged 321.6 yards per game and 22 points per game, which is 15th and last in the SEC respectively.\n\nLooking at the Commodores, they have averaged 367 yards of offense per game, which is 13th in the conference.

Both Kentucky and Vanderbilt received votes for this week’s poll coming off big wins. Vanderbilt ended an 0-60 drought against AP top-five teams by upsetting top-ranked Alabama 40-35 last week. Kentucky is well-rested following an upset of then-No. 6 Mississippi on Sept. 28. The last time the Commodores won consecutive SEC games was in 2022 when they won at Kentucky, then beat Florida.\n\nKey matchup\n\nVanderbilt’s offense might get a lot of attention thanks to the swagger and confidence of its quarterback. The Commodores' 33.5-point average in SEC games ranks fourth, while their 37.6-point overall average stands fifth. The 40 points they hung on ‘Bama was their second-highest total this season. Ole Miss was Kentucky’s first opponent to surpass 300 yards (353), but the Wildcats held the nation’s top offense in scoring, yardage and passing to just 17 points and 262 yards passing.\n\nPlayers to watch\n\nVanderbilt QB Diego Pavia. Not only does the reigning Conference USA offensive player of the year play with a big chip on his shoulder, he also imbues confidence in his teammates by finding the open receiver or crack to run through. Pavia is why Vanderbilt ranks 22nd nationally in scoring at 37.6 points a game. He completed 80% of his passes against the Tide for 252 yards and two TDs.\n\nKentucky WR Dane Key has caught 15 passes for 245 yards and a touchdown the past two games, including a career-high eight receptions for 105 with a score that helped the Wildcats beat Ole Miss. The junior from Lexington had a career-best 145 yards on seven catches in a 41-6 win over Ohio. Key’s team-high 369 yards on 23 catches rank seventh among SEC receivers and he’s ninth all-time in program history with 1,524.\n\nFacts & figures\n\nRECOMMENDED•NJ.COM\n\nWhat channel is Vanderbilt vs. Kentucky game tonight (10/12/24)?

Pedersen  Oct 12, 2024, 4:44pm PDT  22 Comments / 22 New\nShare this story\nShare this on Facebook (opens in new window)\nShare this on Twitter (opens in new window)\nSHARE\nAll sharing options\n\nThe venue keeps changing, but Arizona’s inconsistent, inefficient offense has remained the same.\n\nThe Wildcats once again failed to finish drives after getting deep into opposing territory, finding the end zone on their first drive and not again until it was too late in a 41-19 loss at No. 14 BYU on Saturday afternoon.\n\nArizona (3-3, 1-2 Big 12) got inside the Cougars’ 30-yard line on six of its first nine drives, but like last week’s 28-22 home loss to Texas Tech that’s when the offense fell apart. The Wildcats gained 51 yards on 19 snaps inside the 30 compared to 338 on 65 plays outside the 30.\n\nThe UA was 11 of 19 on third down, a big improvement from the 3-of-14 performance a week ago, but the failures on third down included another interception by Noah Fifita on a throw to the end zone. That came in a 7-7 game in the second quarterback.\n\nFifita turned it over four times, including twice on Arizona’s first three snaps in the second half, which turned a 14-7 halftime deficit into a 24-7 margin. The redshirt sophomore was 26 of 52 for 275 yards with a touchdown but also a career-high three interceptions and a fumble, and for the season has thrown nine picks against eight TD passes.\n\nBYU (6-0, 3-0) was held under 400 yards by an Arizona defense that was already without senior defensive backs Gunner Maldonado and Treydan Stukes but then lost junior linebacker Jacob Manu to a targeting ejection four plays into the game. The Wildcats held the Cougars to 4 of 11 on third down and got another fourth-down stop early but were susceptible to big plays, with BYU getting 224 yards on 12 chunk plays.\n\nDown seven at the half, Arizona’s first two drives in the third quarter lasted a combined three plays, with two of those resulting in turnovers. Fifita was intercepted on the first snap after his throw to Sam Olson in the flat was picked off and then lost a fumble on the third.\n\nBYU needed one play to make it 21-7 after the interception, with BYU QB Jake Retzlaff hitting Chase Roberts on a 9-yard TD pass, but after the fumble recovery the Cougars settled for a field goal and a 24-7 edge.\n\nThe Wildcats gained five yards on their first three post-halftime drives before getting 22 on the fourth, but that was enough to cut the deficit to 24-10 on a 47-yard field goal by Tyler Loop with 6:30 left in the third. Arizona again got inside the BYU 30 before stalling, though, with Fifita getting tripped up trying to scramble on 3rd and 8.\n\nThe Cougars added another field goal to make it 27-10 with 1:47 left in the third, and Arizona again got it back to a 2-score game on a 21-yard Loop field goal with 9:02 remaining, but that came at the end of an 18-play drive that used up more than seven minutes. The Wildcats had 1st and goal at the BYU 8 but threw three straight times, getting only five yards.\n\nBYU then put the game away with a 1-yard TD run by LJ Martin with 5:38 to go.\n\nArizona finally returned the end zone with 2:58 remaining on a 2-yard run by Quali Conley, his 6th rushing score of the season, then went for two and didn’t convert to make it 34-19. It got the ball back with 2:49 after recovering a BYU fumble but turned it over on downs.\n\nCapping the scoring was a pick-six by BYU’s Isaiah Glasker with 1:02 left after Fifita was running for his life in his own end zone on 4th and 10 and threw up a dead duck.\n\nThe Manu ejection came on the fourth play of the game, helping BYU get quickly into the UA red zone. But then the Wildcat defense stiffened, with backups Kamuela Ka’aihue—who came in for Manu—and Dominic Lolesio each posting tackles for loss before Retzlaff threw incomplete out of the end zone on 4th and 4 from the 5.\n\nIt was Arizona’s seventh 4th-down stop of the season, fifth in the state of Utah.\n\nThe UA then marched all the way downfield on its opening drive, gaining 100 yards en route to taking a 7-0 lead. The extra five yards were the result of a penalty on 3rd and 4, which erased a play that would not have gotten the first down, and instead Fifita found McMillan on a 39-yard catch.\n\nThree plays later Fifita connected with Montana Lemonious-Craig for a 14-yard TD pass, also on third down.\n\nBYU tied it at 7 early in the second quarter on a 20-yard TD pass from Retzlaff to Parker Kingston, the score coming one play after the Cougars converted on a 4th and 3 from the UA 35.\n\nArizona was just outside the red zone on its second drive but Fifita was intercepted by BYU’s Tanner Wall at the 1-yard line. It was the eighth consecutive game with a pick for Fifita.\n\nThe Cougars maximized that UA mistake, taking a 14-7 lead with 6:30 left before halftime on a 33-yard TD pass from Kingston to Martin on a trick play. Kingston took a backward pass from Retzlaff and then hit Martin, who had run a wheel route.\n\nArizona’s third drive again got inside the BYU 30 but again fell apart, this time coming up short on 4th and 2 when Quali Conley’s 2-yard gain—that was confirmed by the chains—was then overturned on replay.\n\nThe UA returns home for its next two games, hosting Colorado on Oct. 19 for Homecoming and then West Virginia on Oct. 26 for Family Weekend. The Wildcats’ next game has already sold out and will be another day game, the earliest in the year they’ll be playing at home during the day since 2016.\n\nNEXT UP IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL\n2007: The inside story of the greatest CFB season ever\nMeet the bag man\nThe all-time ‘consensus’ national championships list\nThe evolutionary history of option football\nLoading comments...",

Mandatory Credit: Stephen R. Sylvanie-Imagn Images / Stephen R. Sylvanie-Imagn Images\nIn this story:\nBYU Cougars\n\nBYU football is back. The Cougars are 5-0, ranked no. 14 nationally, hosting Big Noon Kickoff for the first time ever, and firmly in the conference title race. Today, we're predicting BYU vs Arizona.\n\nArizona is desperate for a win after a disappointing loss to Texas Tech last week. A loss to BYU would put Arizona at 3-3 on the season and 1-2 in conference play. The Wildcats are a very dangerous team. They already have a ranked road win this season and they have one of the top two or three wide receivers in the nation: Tetairoa McMillan. Expect Arizona to be motivated in front of a sellout crowd in a game featured by Big Noon Kickoff.\n\nBYU, on the other hand, has thrived in the underdog role this season. BYU is 5-0 against the spread and has been the underdog in every game against P4 competition this season. This game against Arizona is the first time BYU will be favored against a P4 team this season.\n\nBYU has to deal with expectations and outside noise for the first time this season. The Cougars, originally picked to win 4-5 games by Vegas, were picked to finish 13th in the conference this season.\n\nIf LJ Martin is truly healthy again, expect BYU to get him the football early. A consistent rushing attack would open up everything for the BYU offense and take it to new heights.\n\nJake Retzlaff has carried the offense this season. He will need to hit on a couple big plays while taking care of the football.\n\nOn defense, BYU will be tasked with stopping a skilled Arizona offense. The Cougars have forced a turnover in every game this season. Expect a turnover or two that gives the BYU offense a short field.\n\nArizona is capable of pulling off the upset, but BYU is favored for a reason: they are the better football team. If BYU takes care of the football, finishes redzone drives with touchdowns, and creates a turnover or two, the Cougars have a really good chance to win this game. And we think they will.\n\nPrediction: Arizona 23 | BYU 31\n\nPublished 23 Hours Ago\nCASEY LUNDQUIST\n\nCasey Lundquist is the publisher and lead editor of Cougs Daily.

EA Sports College Football 25\nBy Brandon Judd\n\nNote: With EA Sports’ College Football 25 bringing college football back to the video game world, the Deseret News is simulating every BYU game against an FBS opponent this season.\n\nBYU’s first game in October is an important one.\n\nThe Cougars, who are off to a 5-0 start and just one win away from bowl eligibility, will host Arizona on Saturday in a matchup that brought Fox’s “Big Noon Kickoff” to Provo.\n\nSpecial Collector's Issue: \"1984: The Year BYU was Second to None\"\nGet an inclusive look inside BYU Football's 1984 National Championship season.\nBuy Now\n\nCan BYU stay unbeaten and further strengthen its case as a Big 12 contender, or will Arizona march into LaVell Edwards Stadium and walk out with a road win?\n\nThe Deseret News ran a simulation of Saturday’s game on the EA Sports College Football 25 video game — and the outcome went down to the wire.\n\nRELATED\nBYU vs. Arizona: How to watch, listen to or stream the No. 14 Cougars’ Big 12 game\nHow the simulation was set up\n\nThere were a couple of ground rules in place: The simulation used 10-minute quarters and I let the computer simulate the game with no user interference.\n\nCPU ratings have also been adjusted a bit from the standard to make pass defense more realistic — I adjusted the passing accuracy from 50 to 35, then adjusted pass defense ratings from 50 to 80. That helped to create more realistic numbers.\n\nInjuries and depth chart changes were also implemented.\n\nBYU has a full stable of running backs healthy for this game, including LJ Martin and Sione I. Moa, and for the first time in several weeks, Martin could stay atop the BYU depth chart at RB for the simulation.\n\nThe Cougars, though, will be absent wide receiver Kody Epps and, more importantly, center Connor Pay, who suffered a broken foot in the win over Baylor two weeks ago. For the simulation, I subbed in Sonny Makafisi to replace Pay.\n\nArizona, meanwhile, is down two standout defensive backs — Treydan Stukes is out for the year with a reported ACL injury, while Gunner Maldonado is missing time with a lower back injury. Both players were taken off the Wildcats’ depth chart in the secondary.\n\nThe uniforms both teams will be wearing Saturday were also implemented into the simulation. BYU is going with a royal blue jersey and with white helmet and pants adorned with royal trim, while Arizona is going all-white — from helmet to jersey to pants — in its appearance.\n\nHow accurate was the simulation of BYU’s last game?\n\nThe actual score: BYU 34, Baylor 28\n\nCollege Football 25 simulation final score: BYU 38, Baylor 17\n\nMy analysis: Yes, the simulation accurately predicted a BYU win. It was much tighter than the simulation score ended up, though.\n\nThe Cougars led 21-0 in the first quarter and 31-14 at halftime in the actual game, but the Bears rallied to make it a one-score contest and had a chance to take the lead late. BYU’s defense came up big, though, while in the simulation, the Cougars pulled away in the second half.\n\nHow did the simulation between BYU and Arizona play out?\n\nFinal score: BYU 20, Arizona 15\n\nKey sequence: After trailing 20-9, the Wildcats nearly rallied to take the lead.\n\nArizona started what ended up being its final possession at its own 16, and Tetairoa McMillan saved the drive by converting a third and 12 with a 34-yard reception.\n\nThat helped spark the Wildcats, who moved down the field and reached the BYU 1 five plays later on a pass to Jeremiah Patterson.\n\nThat left Arizona in prime position to take its first lead, as it trailed 20-15 with just over two minutes remaining.\n\nOn first and goal, the Cougars dropped Quali Conley for a 2-yard loss to the 3. Then on second down, Arizona’s Noah Fifita tried to hit Patterson in the end zone, but the ball bounced off his hands and BYU’s Jakob Robinson intercepted the tipped ball to end the threat.\n\nThe Cougars were able to run out the clock from there to escape the late rally.\n\nBYU cornerback Jakob Robinson intercepts a pass in the end zone in the final two minutes of a simulated game between BYU and Arizona in the EA Sports College Football 25 video game. | EA Sports College Football 25\n\nHow the simulation transpired: The Cougars never trailed, though Arizona always found ways to stick around in their matchup in Provo.\n\nBYU put up a touchdown on its opening possession when Martin scored from 1 yard out midway through the first quarter. The Cougars converted three third downs on the drive, all passes and on the Arizona side of the field, including a 6-yarder to Darius Lassiter inside the 10 that set up the Martin TD run.\n\nAfter an empty possession for each team, Arizona got on the board with a 55-yard field goal from Tyler Loop as the first quarter ended.\n\nThe second quarter was all about field goals. Jake Retzlaff completed passes of 39 and 30 yards to Keanu Hill and Parker Kingston, respectively, to get BYU inside the red zone on its first drive of the quarter, only for the possession to end with a 34-yard Will Ferrin field goal and a 10-3 lead.\n\nThe Cougars pushed that lead out to 10 on their next possession when Retzlaff was sacked on third and goal from the 1, and it led to a 27-yard Ferrin field goal with just under two minutes until halftime.\n\nArizona responded with a field goal drive of its own, as Loop hit from 50 yards to make it 13-6 at the break.\n\nBoth teams struggled a bit offensively to start the second half before Arizona cut its deficit to 13-9 with another field goal drive, as Loop hit from 48 yards this time with three minutes left in the third quarter.\n\nThat’s when Chase Roberts delivered the Cougars’ top offensive play of the day.\n\nAfter Martin converted a third and 2 with a 4-yard run early in the drive and Hill caught a 12-yard pass, Retzlaff found Roberts open down the middle for a 61-yard catch and run touchdown to lift BYU to a 20-9 lead with one minute left in the third.\n\nThe Wildcats had an answer, though.\n\nMcMillan, the Wildcats’ star receiver, extended Arizona’s next drive with a 19-yard catch on third down, and Conley broke off a 16-yard run on the first play of the fourth quarter to move Arizona into BYU territory.\n\nThat set up another long touchdown, as Fifita hit Montana Lemonious-Craig for a 46-yard touchdown pass less than a minute into the final period.\n\nArizona wide receiver Montana Lemonious-Craig scores on a 46-yard touchdown pass during a simulated game between BYU and Arizona in the EA Sports College Football 25 video game. | EA Sports College Football 25\n\nWith the Wildcats trailing by five, they went for 2, but BYU stopped a run in the backfield to make it a 20-15 game.\n\nThat missed two-point conversion proved critical down the stretch.\n\nOver the next several minutes, BYU had two drives end in punts, while Arizona had its own punt, then the Wildcats took over at their own 16 with just over four minutes remaining with the chance to take the lead.\n\nMcMillan again came up with a big third-down catch, gaining 34 yards on a third-and-12 that sparked the drive. Conley then converted a third-and-inches with a 12-yard run to BYU’s 33, and Fifita found Patterson for a 29-yard pass to BYU’s 1-yard line.\n\nThat’s when the Cougars’ defensive heroics, highlighted by Robinson’s interception, came up big in the final two minutes.\n\nAfter Robinson’s interception, BYU ran out the clock for the win.\n\nStar players: Retzlaff threw for 270 yards and a touchdown and did not turn the ball over. His favorite target was Roberts, who had four catches for 108 yards, while Hill added five receptions for 62 yards.\n\nMartin ran for 64 yards in his first game back since Week 2.\n\nBYU running back LJ Martin scores on a 1-yard run during a simulated game between BYU and Arizona in the EA Sports College Football 25 video game. | EA Sports College Football 25\n\nDefensively, Harrison Taggart had 13 tackles, while Tyler Batty added four tackles, two tackles for loss and one of BYU’s two sacks on the day.\n\nFifita completed 70% of his passes and threw for 273 yards, one touchdown and an interception for Arizona.\n\nLemonious-Craig had seven catches for 125 yards and a touchdown, while McMillan added seven receptions for 77 yards.\n\nConley ran for 114 yards, with a 4.2 per-carry average.\n\nKey stats: The Wildcats outgained the Cougars, 387 total yards to 335, and Arizona went 8 of 15 on third down, compared to 5 of 12 for BYU.\n\nView Comments\n\nThe Cougars, though, finished off their drives better — Arizona never reached the red zone until the end of the game, and BYU forced a turnover on the Wildcats’ only trip inside the 20.\n\nThe Cougars, meanwhile, scored on all three of their red zone trips, though only one was a touchdown while two other drives ended with short field goals.\n\nHow realistic was the simulation?\n\nMy analysis: The BYU-Arizona game has the possibility to be a thriller, and the simulation definitely delivered on a vision for how that could play out.\n\nSaturday’s game may end up a lot like the simulation.\n\nLooking for comments?\nFind comments in their new home!

      "content": "SPORTS\nBYU COUGARS\nWhy cornerback Jakob Robinson will never forget his 10th career interception\nSenior’s pick led to an easy BYU touchdown and Cougars rolled from there to 41-19 win over Arizona\nPublished: Oct 12, 2024, 9:01 p.m. MDT\nVIEW COMMENTS\nSHARE\nBrigham Young Cougars cornerback Jakob Robinson (0) celebrates an interception against the Texas Tech Red Raiders in Provo on Saturday, Oct. 21, 2023. BYU won 27-14. Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News\nBy Jay Drew\nJay has covered sports in Utah for more than 30 years and has been writing for the Deseret News since 2019.\n\nBYU senior cornerback Jakob Robinson is evidently a difficult man to impress — at least when the Orem High product is doing the impressing.\n\nAfter his interception of Arizona quarterback Noah Fifita drastically turned the momentum of Saturday’s game in BYU’s favor the first play of the second half, Robinson said the deflection and pick ranks only among the best in his career in Provo.\n\n“I would say maybe top five,” Robinson said. “OK, definitely top five.”\n\nSpecial Collector's Issue: \"1984: The Year BYU was Second to None\"\nGet an inclusive look inside BYU Football's 1984 National Championship season.\nBuy Now\n\nSet up at Arizona’s 9-yard-line, Jake Retzlaff threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to Chase Roberts that was tipped at the line of scrimmage to give BYU a two-touchdown lead, and the Cougars cruised from there to a 41-19 win over the Wildcats in front of 64,420 fans at LaVell Edwards Stadium.\n\nIt was the same end zone in which Robinson made an interception at the beginning of last season that kept Sam Houston from scoring and preserved BYU’s 14-0 win in that opener. That one was big; this one felt 10 times bigger.\n\nHere’s how Robinson described it:\n\n“Man, it was crazy. We were in a corner blitz from the boundary. I always love it, because when coach (Jay) Hill calls a corner blitz, he knows we are probably either going to get home or make a play.\n\n“Yeah, he just called it, and I saw the quarterback look at a tight end in motion and he just tried to throw, so I stuck my hand out and caught it.”\n\nRELATED\nHighlights and key plays from BYU's 41-19 win over Arizona\nBYU uses its unique ticket to punch Arizona, get bowl eligible\n\nSafety Tanner Wall and linebacker Isaiah Glasker also picked off Fifita — the first time the Arizona QB has been intercepted three times in a single game — and Glasker returned his interception 21 yards for a touchdown to complete the scoring.\n\n“Honestly, coach Hill puts us in the best position to make plays. He scouts (opponents) super good,” Robinson said. “He knows what plays are coming, and then he will try to put us in the best call to make a play. Everyone just does their job and it just takes you right to the play.”\n\nRobinson said the game plan was to get Fifita to scramble to his left, “because he is not as good at scrambling left, but he is really good at scrambling right.”\n\nHead coach Kalani Sitake said Hill has a variety of blitzes dialed up and ready to go, taking advantage of each defender’s strengths. The Cougars had Fifita dead to rights at least a half-dozen times, but only sacked him once.\n\nHe’s as slippery a QB as the Cougars have seen this season, and they have seen some really elusive ones.\n\n“Jakob has done an amazing job of always getting ready for the games, and then he just has really good instincts. You guys have seen that for many years now, him making plays,” Sitake said.\n\n“The only thing I can say about that one is just score next time, but yeah, what an amazing player and great leader.”\n\nRobinson is the type of player who leads by example, instead of his words, Sitake said.\n\n“He is a soft-spoken guy, but man, he makes a lot of noise when he is on the field, and makes a lot of plays,” the coach said. “Really proud of him being able to do that and just kind of set the momentum for the rest of the game.”\n\nView Comments\n\nWall’s pick was also impressive, because it saved points and it also set the Cougars up for a 99-yard touchdown drive that made a statement that the offense could move the ball on an Arizona defense that gave up only 10 points to Utah.\n\n“Tanner has really improved, like crazy. So he was actually shading over to (one) side, but he made the play on the other side,” Robinson said. “That is just him using his good eyes and reading and going to make plays.”\n\nAs far as making a statement with the sixth win, Robinson said the Cougars are far from finished.\n\n“We are bowl eligible, but that is not really what I have been thinking of,” he said. “I want to get to the national championship for us, so that is definitely my thought.”\n\nLooking for comments?\nFind comments in their new home!

They'll host Panama in Austin, Texas with high expectations. Key names like Folarin Balogun, Gio Reyna, Tim Weah, and Tyler Adams may be absent from this camp, but that also offers an opportunity for others to step up and impress their new manager. One of those names will be Josh Sargent, in good form with Norwich City, he's been able to add creativity into his game which is music to Christian Pulisic's ears. \n\n\"I think he's a fantastic player, one of the best offensive players in the world,\" Pochettino said about Pulisic in his pre-match press conference. Looking at Pulisic's form with Milan, it's hard to argue with that. Pulisic has six goals and two assists in all competitions for Milan, becoming the first name on the team sheet. It's not like he's shooting more this season either, Pulisic has just been ruthless with the chances that he gets. His shot volume has actually decreased, dropping from 2.23 per 90 minutes to 1.80 but his expected goals per 90 minutes have almost doubled, going from 0.28 to 0.52, similarly his goal scoring rate has jumped from 0.41 to0.82 per 90 minutes. Now the question is whether he can bring that ruthless efficiency to the national team.\n\nThe USMNT will see plenty of compact defenses and it's up to Pulisic to find his way through them. As more attention shifts toward stopping him in Serie A play, Pulisic has shown that he can still get a great shot off and he'll need to continue doing that during this international break.\n\nHere's our storylines, how you can watch the match and more:\n\nGolazo Starting XI Newsletter\nYour ultimate guide to the Beautiful Game as our experts take you beyond the pitch and around the globe with news that matters.\n\nI agree to receive the \"Golazo Starting XI Newsletter\" and marketing communications, updates, special offers (including partner offers), and other information from CBS Sports and the Paramount family of companies.\nBy pressing sign up, I confirm that I have read and agree to the Terms of Use and acknowledge Paramount's Privacy Policy.\nHow to watch and odds\n\nDate: Saturday, Oct. 13 | Time: 9 p.m. ET\nLocation: Q2 Stadium -- Austin, Texas\nTV: TNT  | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nOdds: USMNT -215; Draw +290; Panama +550\nStorylines\n\nUSMNT: With only one win in their last seven matches, the team will need to show that they're ready to go to work under Pochettino. There are good feelings around their potential under the Argentine but those feelings will only last as long as the USMNT shows that they are ready to compete. Training has been intense so far and the off-halves that they've had recently won't be tolerated under Pochettino but it's still about how this team can respond under the new manager against a team that they should defeat.\n\nUSMNT Lineup Prediction: Zack Steffen, Marlon Fossey, Mark McKenzie, Tim Ream, Antonee Robinson, Aidan Morris, Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah, Malik Tillman, Christian Pulisic, Josh Sargent\n\nPanama: This Panama side has been improving and will look to put their own Copa America disappointment, a 5-0 loss to Colombia, behind them. They were able to defeat the USMNT in the group stage of that tournament to secure their own advancement to the knockout stages but the team that takes the pitch for the USMNT will be quite different than the one that lost at the Copa America. Thomas Christiansen has worked wonders in charge of Panama but he'll have quite a battle to outmatch Pochettino.\n\nPrediction\n\nIn what will be a gritty match, the USMNT will do just enough to secure a victory which will be a bright spot considering their recent form. Pick: USMNT 2, Panama 1",

For help with a gambling problem call 1-877-8HOPE-NY or text HOPENY (467369).\n\nHere’s a recent USA Soccer story by The Associated Press:\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Zack Steffen remembers the phone call, the one he considers the toughest moment of his career.\n\nIt was coach Gregg Berhalter in late 2022 telling the goalkeeper he was not part of the United States' World Cup roster, even as some viewed him as the No. 1 pick over Matt Turner.\n\nA surprise cut then, the 29-year-old Steffen was called back to the national team for Mauricio Pochettino’s first roster as Berhalter’s successor ahead of friendlies against Panama on Saturday in Austin and versus Mexico three days later in Guadalajara.\n\n“This is a really proud moment,” Steffen said this week at the team’s training camp. “And this was a big goal of mine, to get back into the mix. It feels great to be back.\n\n“The coaches have confidence in me. They’re seeing me. They believe in me. And throwing on the U.S. jersey again, you’re working for something bigger than yourself,\" he said.\n\nSteffen, who has 29 international appearances, seemed like a lock for the 2022 World Cup. He had started six qualifiers and was seen as the go-to keeper for Berhalter, who coached Columbus when Steffen was the MLS goalkeeper of the year in 2018.\n\nSteffen’s spiral out of the squad in 2022 had perhaps started months before the dreadful phone call from Berhalter.\n\nAfter three seasons under contract with Manchester City produced only two appearances in Premier League matches, he was still No. 1 for the U.S. when he skipped the national team training camp and four World Cup warmup games in June 2022.\n\nSteffen said the break was needed because “I was struggling mentally, was not in a good place in my life. I was struggling over in England.”\n\nStruggles that began with the pandemic lockdowns and carried on for years.\n\n“After a long, grueling season at City, I needed a reset with my family. I didn’t think I was in the right frame of mind,” Steffen said. “I decided to pull out. It was late, about a week before. It wasn’t good timing, but it was something I needed to do.”\n\nBy fall, Steffen was also hobbled by a knee problem early in the club season when he was on loan to second-division club Middlesborough.\n\nBerhalter picked Turner, Ethan Horvath and Sean Johnson for his roster, and Turner played all four matches in Qatar. Steffen said he doesn’t know if the decision to leave him off the World Cup squad was a performance issue, or whether the skipped training camp damaged his relationship with Berhalter.\n\n“That’s something you have to ask Gregg. I think I was starting to get in my groove,” Steffen said.\n\nBerhalter was fired in July after an early exit from Copa America. And Steffen is back.\n\n“He fits back into the fold same as he did. It’s an opportunity to again try to prove himself and get himself back on the team,\" said defender Antonee Robinson, a U.S. teammate and a Premier League rival at Fulham.\n\n“Happy to have him,” Robinson said. “It sounds like he’s enjoying his football again and he’s in a much better place than he was before.”\n\nSteffen agrees with that assessment.\n\n“Absolutely. I’m married, with a beautiful daughter, just bought a house and have some stability, so yeah,” Steffen said.\n\nSteffen returned to Major League Soccer in January on a three-year contract with Colorado and has started all 31 matches. He hasn’t played for the national team since the final qualifiers in March 2022, though he was on the bench for CONCACAF Nations League matches a year later.\n\nThe U.S. is an automatic qualifier for the 2026 World Cup as co-host with Mexico and Canada. Pochettino’s charge is to lead the U.S. deep into a tournament in which it hasn’t reached the quarterfinals since 2002 and the semifinals since 1930.\n\n“He deserved the opportunity to be with us,” Pochettino said of Steffen. “It’s a good opportunity to see him and analyze.”\n\nSargent injury\n\nForward Josh Sargent said he is in a “really good place” after nagging ankle injuries kept him performing with the national team over the last year at the same level he has with his second-division club Norwich in England.\n\nSargent got hurt when Huddersfield goalkeeper Lee Nicholls stepped on an ankle on Aug. 26, 2023. He returned Dec. 29 but has had recurring issues and was limited to a reserve role in the Copa America.\n\n“It’s been a while since I’ve been in good health and good form while I’ve been here and been able to play,” Sargent said. “At the moment I feel really good, ankle feels really good. There is a new manager, so I’m excited to see what I can do.”\n\nWATCH YOUR FAVORITE TEAMS\nBest WNBA Finals streaming options: How to watch Liberty vs. Lynx, Sabrina Ionescu live for FREE\nMLB Playoffs TV schedule: How to watch 2024 ALDS & NLDS games today\nNFL Slimetime 2024 on Nickelodeon: How to watch season premiere with Nate Burleson for free\nBuffalo Bills TV schedule 2024: How to watch free live streams today\nNY Jets TV schedule 2024: How to watch free live streams today\n\nWhat is fuboTV?\n\nFuboTV is a live TV streaming service focused on live sports, including U.S. and international soccer, the NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL and more.

Also collected a stoppage-time save and hit some very decent long passes.\n\nAntonee Robinson (Off 68'): 7.5 — A couple nervy moments stop this from being a vintage “Jedi” star show in a USMNT shirt, but he was still very good. Great work on the left flank to help set-up Pulisic’s assist. Was leading all players in defensive actions with six when he subbed off.\n\nTim Ream: 7 — Much better this window after two uncharacteristically difficult showings in September.\n\nMark McKenzie: 7.5 — Game-high 96 touches and nine defensive actions. Beaten by Fajardo on a fortunate late Panama miss, but told Pochettino plenty with a calm showing even under late duress.\n\nJoe Scally: 7 — A quiet day for a player who managed 80-plus touches. Allowed a cutback in the second half that led to Turner’s double save.\n\nAidan Morris: 8 — Strong day for the ex-Columbus and current Middlesbrough midfielder, who won all four of his duels and trailed only McKenzie in touches. Very tidy in the middle of the park.\n\nGianluca Busio (Off 68'): 6.5 — One bad giveaway but otherwise tidy on the ball, passing at 93%.\n\nYunus Musah (Off 84'): 8 — The goal was good, of course, but it was more encouraging to see a confident Musah marauding up and down the right side. Wasn’t on the ball as much as we’ve come to expect, as Morris and Busio were central.\n\nBrenden Aaronson (Off 78'): 6.5 — Typically frenetic, at times anxious, but ran his shorts off and had some fantastic moments on the dribble and in distribution.\n\nChristian Pulisic (Off 68'): 7.5 — Only Sargent had more touches in the Panama box than Pulisic, who rang up his 17th assist in a USMNT shirt and could have also scored himself.\n\nJosh Sargent (Off 68'): 6.5 — Active and strong, drove play on multiple occasions and showed presence when going up from long balls from Turner and friends. Missed a strong chance to open the scoring and that will sting him deep into the night as the competition for center forward minutes is open under Pochettino.\n\nSubs\nRicardo Pepi (On 68'): 7 — Only six touches but one was a goal and that’s where center forwards make their money!\nTanner Tessmann (On 68'): 6.5 — Mass changes generally lead to chaos, and Tessmann was victim of this as both teams scrapped late.\nHaji Wright (On 68'): 7.5 — Twice made moves to set up danger. One was denied by an imprecise pass, but the second was an assist to Pepi.\nKristoffer Lund (On 68'): 8 — Very impressive on the left again.\nMalik Tillman (On 78'): 7 — Helped set up the goal. Have a feeling we’ll see him in the XI versus Mexico.\nAlex Zendejas (On 84'): N/A\n\n\nRelated Stories\nThree things we learned from Mauricio Pochettino’s debut as USMNT head coach\nAndy Edwards\n7h\nUSMNT 2-0 Panama: Winning start for Pochettino\nNicholas Mendola\n8h\nUSMNT upcoming schedule — Mexico friendly then CONCACAF Nations League\nNicholas Mendola\n,\nAndy Edwards\n8h\nUSMNT records — All-time scoring leaders, cap-winners, coaches\nNicholas Mendola\n8h\nHow to watch Argentina vs Ecuador live: Stream link, TV channel, team news, prediction\nNicholas Mendola\n9h\nUEFA Nations League 2024-25: Fixtures, scores, results, tables, details\nNicholas Mendola\n11h\nThe 2 Robbies Podcast\nRobbie Mustoe and Robbie Earle discuss and dissect the top Premier League storylines after every single match week.

      "content": "USMNT Predicted Lineup vs. Panama: International Friendly\nChristian Pulisic should be the first name on the USMNT sheet.\nBraden Chalker | Oct 12, 2024\nChristian Pulisic could start for the USMNT / Katie Stratman-Imagn Images\n\nAll eyes will be on the U.S. men's national team friendly clash against Panama this weekend to see Mauricio Pochettino take the touchline for the first time as the team's new head coach.\n\nThe Stars and Stripes' last two encounters against Panama didn't exactly go to plan. Juventus forward Tim Weah—who's set to miss the upcoming match through injury—was sent off as the USMNT fell 2–1 in the 2024 Copa América group stage. In the summer of 2023, USMNT was unable to get past Panama in the Gold Cup semi finals, coming up short on penalty kicks.\n\nAlthough it might be a friendly match on paper, USA might have a chip on its shoulder to get one back over its CONCACAF foes while players will be eager to impress the new boss in the dugout.\n\nGiven the current available players in Pochettino's first squad as head coach, it seems like he'll more than likely roll with a 4-3-3 setup potentially playing Christian Pulisic on the right-hand side to integrate rising star Malik Tillman into the frontline. With Crystal Palace defender Chris Richards out through injury, ex-Atlanta United defender Miles Robinson could take his place in defense next to the veteran Tim Ream.\n\nHere's how Pochettino's XI could look in his first match as USMNT boss.\n\nUSMNT Predicted Lineup vs. Panama (4-3-3)\n\nGK: Matt Turner—The experienced shot-stopper didn't have the best time at this summer's Copa América and is still waiting to play his first minutes on loan at Palace. However, Pochettino will want to get a good look at him before casting him aside with players like Patrick Schulte, Gabriel Slonina and Zack Steffen eagerly awaiting their chance to get in between the sticks.\n\nRB: Joe Scally—The 21-year-old should keep his place in the side with Sergiño Dest still out with an ACL injury. Scally's versatility could help him become a key player for Pochettino as he's started all six of Borussia Mönchengladbach's Bundesliga matches.\n\nCB: Miles Robinson—Robinson is still hoping to make that leap to Europe in the near future after impressing in his first season with his new team FC Cincinnati. He should get the nod in the heart of the defense.\n\nCB: Tim Ream—The Charlotte FC defender's international career is going to come to an end sooner rather than later but Pochettino will want to see what he's working with in Ream. It's unlikely that Ream plays a starting role in the 2026 World Cup but he might be a useful squad player to mentor younger players in the camp in the buildup to the tournament on home soil.\n\nLB: Antonee Robinson—Robinson continues to be a key player in Marco Silva's Fulham side in the Premier League and that theme should continue in the USMNT setup. It will be difficult for any defender to upend Robinson from the starting XI regardless of who's on the touchline.\n\nCM: Brenden Aaronson—The Leeds United midfielder gets a start with some freedom to get forward and create in the attacking third.\n\nJOIN SI SOCCER'S USMNT WHATSAPP COMMUNITY - GET ALL THE LATEST NEWS AND ANALYSIS STRAIGHT TO YOUR PHONE\n\nCM: Weston McKennie—The former Schalke 04 and Leeds United player is typically one of the first names on the team sheet. His work rate is what really makes the team tick and Pochettino will look to get the best out of him.\n\nCM: Yunus Musah—While Pochettino said that it's important for USMNT players to be getting regular minutes at their respective clubs, Musah just might be an exception. The young midfielder might be a little rusty from the start but his talent should shine through alongside McKennie and Cardoso.\n\nRW: Christian Pulisic—The 26-year-old's red-hot start to the new season should be more than enough to keep him in the team. Pulisic typically plays out on the right-wing for AC Milan—where he's managed six goals in nine appearances so far this term—and Pochettino could look to utilize him in the same space on the international stage.\n\nST: Josh Sargent—Sargent should get the chance to lead the line with Folarin Balogun potentially missing out through injury. He's started the season off well for Norwich City with seven goal contributions and hopes to translate that to the USMNT this international break.\n\nLW: Malik Tillman—If there's one young player who deserves more minutes in the USMNT setup, it's Malik Tillman. The 22-year-old should be in line for more minutes this international break with Gio Reyna and Weah both unavailable for selection. He's tallied four goals in eight appearances for PSV Eindhoven in the Eredivisie.\n\nREAD THE LATEST USMNT NEWS, PREVIEWS, PREDICTIONS, TRANSFER RUMORS AND MORE\n•\nYunus Musah Scores First Goal of Mauricio Pochettino USMNT Era\n•\nUSMNT's Forward Options: Ranked\n•\nUSMNT Coach's New Look Draws Comparison to Iconic TV Coach\n•\nUSMNT Players Praise Mauricio Pochettino's 'Intense' Training Sessions\nPublished Oct 12, 2024\nBRADEN CHALKER\n\nBraden Chalker is a freelance writer for Sports Illustrated Soccer covering Major League Soccer and the U.S. men's national team.\n\nFollow braden_chalker",

      "content": "USMNT shakes off malaise, wins new coach Mauricio Pochettino's debut\nNANCY ARMOUR   USA TODAY\nShow Caption\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — It just hits different when it's Mauricio Pochettino telling the U.S. men’s national team he has confidence in them.\n\nPochettino has won titles. Taken Tottenham to the Champions League final. Coached a team that had Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappé and Neymar. If Pochettino tells players he believes in them, gives them the green light to play with freedom, how could you not walk a little taller and play with more authority?\n\nA 2-0 victory over Panama on Saturday night in Pochettino's first game with the USMNT doesn't fix all the team's problems. But it was obvious the Americans have shed the malaise that has plagued them for months, and that's every bit as important as snapping their four-game winless streak.\n\n\"It was huge. He's been speaking about confidence all week,\" said Tim Ream, chosen by Pochettino to captain the USMNT for his first game in charge. \"He wants us to be solid defensively and then have guys play the way they are comfortable playing.\n\n\"When he tells guys to go and be themselves, it's a sign he has confidence in you. And you can see that come out with all the guys out there,\" Ream added. \"Knowing the caliber of manager that he is, the caliber of players he's managed previously, for him to come in and give guys that license to be themselves, play with intensity but do it going forward in the right areas, it allows guys to express themselves more and more and more and be confident doing it.\"\n\nThe victory was only the fourth this year for the USMNT. It also was the Americans' first multi-goal game since June 23. Yunus Musah scored his first goal with the USMNT, in the 49th minute, and Ricardo Pepi added an insurance goal deep in second-half stoppage time.\n\n\"This was a first step to start to grow and be better,\" Pochettino said.\n\nThe USMNT now heads to Mexico, where it plays archrival El Tri in Guadalajara in a friendly on Tuesday night. The first competitive match with Pochettino comes next month, though the opponent (and site) for the Nations League quarterfinal is still to be determined.\n\nAfter an abysmal showing at Copa America this summer, including only the third loss ever to Panama, U.S. Soccer fired Gregg Berhalter and went after Pochettino. It was a bold — and pricey — move to entice one of the most successful managers in European club soccer to take his first national team job, but the federation didn’t have a choice. The United States is co-hosting the 2026 World Cup along with Canada and Mexico, and U.S. Soccer hopes it will elevate the sport here much like the 1994 tournament did.\n\nWhile soccer has a much higher profile now than it did 30 years ago, it lags behind the NFL and NBA and the talent pool still isn’t what it should be in a country this size. A deep run in 2026 could change that — but not with the direction the USMNT was heading.\n\nPochettino has said repeatedly this first camp was about getting to know players and, equally importantly, the players getting to know him and his staff. He wants players to know he has their backs. When Pochettino was asked why he left regular starter Weston McKennie on the bench, Pochettino said it was because the midfielder had arrived in camp a little banged up and he wasn't going to risk McKennie aggravating anything further.\n\nPochettino also moved Musah, who has been fighting for playing time at AC Milan, outside. It's a position where Musah has had success in the past and, sure enough, he came through with his first goal, club or country, in more than two years.\n\nReam sent a looping ball up the field to Antonee Robinson, who controlled it on the sideline before sliding it to Christian Pulisic. Pulisic and Brenden Aaronson then had a give-and-go before Pulisic fed the streaking Musah, his teammate in Milan.\n\n\"I've been in that position (of not playing) before,\" Pulisic said. \"It's a great opportunity to come and to show yourself and put on a good performance.\"\n\nThat's also what Matt Turner did.\n\nThe veteran goalkeeper, currently with Crystal Palace, has struggled to get consistent playing time since moving to England in 2022. But Pochettino gave him the start Saturday, and he preserved the lead with saves in quick succession on two shots from close range in the 52nd minute. He batted the first shot away, but it fell to another Panama player and Turner made a kick save to block the second shot.\n\n\"Amazing performance from my view. Of course I’m not a specialist (but) I think he was fantastic,\" Pochettino said. \"I'm so happy for him because he’s suffering in his own club. That’s a way to show he can fight for a place in his club.\"\n\nPochettino made some tactical changes, with the USMNT coming out in a 4-2-3-1 formation. He gave young players like Aidan Morris and Gianluca Busio a chance to prove themselves. But it was the attitude — the swagger — that Pochettino brings that was the most noticeable difference, and the players responded.\n\n\"We are here,\" he said, \"to help the players find their best.\"\n\nThe USMNT wasn't at its best against Panama. It was better than it's been in a long while, though, and that's a good place to start.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on social media @nrarmour.\n\nThis story was updated to add new information.\n\n \n ",

From “Dreams” to “Landslide” and “Edge of Seventeen” from her first solo album, Nicks’ sultry vocals are instantly recognizable. And she’s still delivering powerhouse performances today. \n\nHow to Watch\n\nWatch Saturday Night Live Saturdays at 11:30/10:30c on NBC and next day on Peacock.  \n\nOn October 12, Nicks will perform as a Musical Guest on Season 50 of Saturday Night Live, with Ariana Grande as the episode’s Host. The last time the singer appeared on NBC’s long-running sketch comedy show was in 1983 when she performed “Stand Back” and “Night Bird” from her solo album, The Wild Heart. \n\nRELATED: The SNL Cast Goes Full Wizard of Oz in Ariana Grande's New SNL Promo\n\nAt 76 years old, Nicks continues to release captivating and powerful new music. Her newest single “The Lighthouse” was inspired by the overturning of Roe v. Wade, and it quickly topped Billboard charts. “I have often said to myself: This may be the most important thing I ever do, to stand up for the women of the United States and their daughters and granddaughters — and the men that love them,” Nicks said in a statement in September 2024. “This is an anthem.”\n\nNicks’ music career spans decades, and it’s always fascinating to look back at the trajectory. Read on to revisit when Nicks got her start in the industry as a young 20-something, her musical relationship with Lindsey Buckingham, and see photos of her from the '70s and '80s, all featuring her iconic style.\n\nStevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac posed, sitting on car.

The two later released an album titled Buckingham Nicks. They met in high school in the ‘60s but didn’t start dating until years later. \n\nStevie Nicks performs alongside Lindsey Buckingham at the Los Angeles Forum, Inglewood, California, December 6, 1979.

But the one thing that happened from that attempt was that people singled out Stevie and myself more than once,” Buckingham told Dan Rather in an April 2024 interview. “When Fritz broke up, Stevie and I were looking at each other going ‘Well, what now?’ and thought we could try doing a duet. So at that point, we actually did get romantically involved and we got musically involved as a duet.”\n\nStevie Nicks poses for a portrait in circa 1974.

More importantly, it was noticed by Mick Fleetwood.” \n\nNicks told The New Yorker she and Buckingham ended their romantic relationship in 1976. \n\nStevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac and husband Kim Anderson Photo: Ron Galella, Ltd\nStevie Nicks joined Fleetwood Mac in 1974 \nMick Fleetwood, Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie, John McVie and Lindsey Buckingham pose for photographers backstage at the 5th American Music Awards held at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on January 16, 1978.

Initially, only Buckingham was asked to join the band as a guitarist. \n\n\"One day I get this call from Mick Fleetwood, saying 'Hey, you remember me?' He says, 'How would you like to join Fleetwood Mac? We're looking for a guitarist,’” Buckingham recalled in an interview with The Smith Center in 2020. \"I said, 'If you're going to take me, you have to take my girlfriend, too.'\" \n\nJohn McVie, Lindsey Buckingham, Christine McVie, Stevie Nicks, and Mick Fleetwood.

Aaron/Redferns\n\nWhile still a member of Fleetwood Mac, Nicks released her debut solo album, Bella Donna, in 1981, which features one of the musician’s most popular songs, “Edge of Seventeen.”\n\nStevie Nicks poses for a photo backstage in 1985 in Los Angeles, California Photo: Donaldson Collection\n\nOn the 40th anniversary of the album’s release, Nicks posted an entry from her journal on Instagram reflecting on the record and why she chose only female backing vocalists to work on it with her. \n\n“Bella Donna was a dream. I chose Lori Perry-Nicks and Sharon Celani as my army to go on that journey with me. I wanted us to sound like the girl version of Crosby Stills and Nash. I did not want the record to sound anything like Fleetwood Mac — that would have defeated the dream,” she wrote, adding that the creation of the album “did not break up Fleetwood Mac. If anything, it kept us together.”\n\nStevie Nicks performs at the Various in Los Angeles, California Photo: Lester Cohen/WireImage\n\nAs a solo artist, Nicks has released eight albums. She's also collaborated with several musicians, including the late Tom Petty. \"She’s a good friend. I’ve known her since 1978, and she’s insisted on being in my life,\" Petty told The Toronto Sun of their friendship in 2014. \"Some of my best musical memories of her are sitting on the couch and just playing the guitar while she sings.”\n\nTom Petty & Stevie Nicks perform onstage in 1981.

In 2025, she'll go on tour with Billy Joel and Sting.\n\nStevie Nicks performs onstage during the US Festival, Ontario, California, May 30, 1983.

Sampson's score was his third of the game for the league's rushing leader and came after his 23-yard touchdown run in the fourth period put the Vols ahead for the first time with just under 10 minutes to play. The Gators, 15 1/2-point underdogs, rallied to tie the score behind freshman quarterback DJ Lagway after starting sixth-year Graham Mertz left the game in the third quarter after suffering what appeared to be a knee injury. Lagway fired a 23-yard touchdown pass to Chimere Dike on a third-and-19 play with just 29 seconds remaining in regulation to make the score 17-16 and stun the crowd of more than 102,000. UF coach Billy Napier, at first, kept his offense on the field and threatened a two-point conversion attempt -- and a go at the win -- but after Tennessee called a desperation timeout and reset, Napier opted to send Trey Smack out to kick the point-after and play for overtime. UT won the coin toss and chose to play defense first. The Gators ran three plays, lost four yards and turned to Smack, who earlier kicked a 42-yard field goal. His OT attempt from 47, however, was pushed right, leaving Tennessee to play for the win. The Vols needed five plays to go the 25 yards, with Sampson crashing across on second-and-goal from the 1 and giving the Volunteers just their third win in the last 20 games of this series. Sampson, who came into the game with 589 rushing yards and 12 TDs, finished with 112 on 27 attempts and the three scores. Defensively, UF did a mostly outstanding job of containing a UT offense that began the day ranked No. 5 in the nation at 519.0 yards per game, as the Vols finishing with a season-low 312 yards and nearly dropped a second game in as many weeks as a top 10-ranked team. UT sophomore quarterback Nico Iamaleava completed 16 of 26 passes for 169 yards, no scores, an interception and was sacked three times. Lagway finished nine of 17 for 98 yards, the one score, one interception and three sacks, as the Gators actually out-gained the Vols with 361 yards of total offense. Mertz was 11-for-15 for 125 yards and a touchdown, with his 13-yard scoring toss to tight end Arlis Boardingham giving the Gators a 10-0 lead in the third quarter, but also ending with UF's starting quarterback suffering a non-contact injury at the end of the play. Mertz joined starting tailback Montrell Johnson Jr. (12 carries, 85 yards before going down with a lower body injury early in the third quarter) on the sidelines, as the two had to watch the Vols rally from their 10-0 deficit. The UF lead could have been much more, but the Gators self-destructed on a trio of drives that penetrated the UT 20 in the first half and netted no points. First, wideout Eugene Wilson III was tackled for a yard loss on a fourth-and-1 jet sweep. Next, Mertz fumbled on a first-down sneak attempt at the Vols' 1. And, lastly, after a Florida interception, Smack had a converted 43-yard field goal taken off the board on the final play of the first half when the Gators were flagged for 12 men on the field. Because they had no timeouts and could not accept a 10-second clock run-off, the half ended with the penalty and without a re-kick. UF finally found the end zone on its second possession of the second half, when Mertz moved the Gators 92 yards in nine plays, then lobbed his score to Boardingham. UT needed less than five minutes to find the end zone for the first time, with Iamaleava driving the Vols 75 yards in 11 plays and Sampson crashing in on a fourth-and-1 with a six-yard scoring run. On the very next play from scrimmage, Lagway threw an interception in minus-territory that led to a 35-yard Max Gilbert field goal that tied the game at 10 with 1:37 left in the third quarter. Sampson's second TD about five minutes later made it 17-10 and set up the frantic finish. \nThe Florida defense bottled up standout Tennessee tailback Dylan Sampson, the SEC's rushing leader, in the first half and kept the Gators in the game Saturday night in Knoxville. \nWHAT IT MEANS: Just the third loss to Tennessee since 2005, but it very well could have gone differently -- and maybe given Napier the biggest win of his three UF seasons, as well as some promising possibilities for the program -- had the Gators not blown those three outstanding first-half scoring chances. \n\nIN THE SPOTLIGHT: The Florida defense has made some impressive strides since those two debacle performances in home losses to Miami and Texas A&M early in the season. The guys on that side of the ball put the Gators in position to steal what would have been a victory virtually no one was counting on.\n\nSTAGGERING STATISTIC: Florida was 3-for-6 in the red zone, with those three come-up-empty killers all in the second quarter. Tennessee was 3-for-3 in the red zone. There's the game.\n\nUP NEXT: Florida (3-3, 1-2) will be back at \"The Swamp\" for a homecoming date against Kentucky (3-3, 1-3), which has beaten the Gators three straight and four of the previous five after losing 31 straight in the series from 1987-2017. The Wildcats had a two-game winning streak snapped late Saturday night by losing at home against college football's 2024 giant-killer, Vanderbilt, which followed last week's stunning upset of No. 1 Alabama by going to Lexingtone and handing the favored Wildcats a 20-13 defeat. \nPrint Friendly Version\nRELATED\nVIDEOS\nPlay Video\nVideo / Billy Napier Press Conference 10-7-24\nPlay Video\nVideo / Chimere Dike Media Availability 10-7-24\nPlay Video\nVideo / R.J.

Tennessee then drove 25 yards on its overtime possession to win the game, scoring on a one-yard TD run by Dylan Sampson.\n\nLagway was pressed into action for most of the second half after quarterback Graham Mertz left the game with a leg injury after throwing a 13-yard TD pass to tight end Arlis Boardingham early in the third quarter, which gave UF a 10-0 lead.\n\nWith Mertz out, Tennessee rallied to score 17 straight points, going up 17-10 on a 23-yard TD by Sampson with 9:42 remaining.\n\nSampson has rushed for 101 yards and 3 TDs for the Vols (4-1, 1-1 SEC).\n\nFlorida went 1-for-4 on red zone chances in the first half, bungling some golden scoring opportunities, and took only a 3-0 lead into halftime.\n\nWATCH FLORIDA FOOTBALL VS TENNESSEE ON HULU (FREE TRIAL)\n\nFlorida football vs Tennesse score updates\nTeam\t1Q\t2Q\t3Q\t4Q\tScore\nFlorida\t3\t0\t7\t7\t17\nTennessee\t0\t0\t10\t7\t17\nFlorida football ties score at 17\n\nFlorida football ties the score at 17 as DJ Lagway finds receiver Chimere Dike on a 27-yard TD pass with 29 seconds left.\n\nTennessee football takes first lead of the game\n\nTennessee takes its first lead of the game as tailback Dylan Sampson caps a 2-play, 29-yard drive with a 23-yard TD run, putting the Vols up 17-10 on Florida with 9:42 left.\n\nTennessee ties score off Florida football turnover\n\nOff an interception by Florida freshman quarterback DJ Lagway, Tennessee ties the score 10-10 on a 35-yard Max Gilbert field goal.

Starting Florida running back Montrell Johnson Jr. also is out.\n\nTennessee football scores first TD\n\nTennessee scores its first touchdown of the game, as the Vols cap an 11-play, 75-yard TD drive with a 6-yard TD run by Dylan Sampson, cutting UF's lead to 10-7 with 2:57 left in the half.\n\nFlorida football scores first TD, QB Graham Mertz hobbles off field\n\nFlorida finally finds paydirt in the red zone as Graham Mertz connects with tight end Arlis Boardingham on a 13-yard TD pass, putting the Gators up 10-0 with 7:18 left in the third quarter. But the touchdown came at a price as Mertz hobbled off the field with an apparent lower leg injury after the play. Running back Montrell Johnson Jr. also twisted his knee after long run during the nine-play, 92-yard TD drive but appears to be fine after going into the injury tent. Johnson has 85 yards rushing on 12 carries.\n\nFlorida football blows another scoring opportunity\n\nFlorida bugled another scoring chance to end the first half. A Sharif Denson interception set UF up in the red zone for another scoring chance. But with Florida out of time outs, quarterback Graham Mertz was sacked, forcing the Florida field goal unit to rush onto the field as the clock was ticking down to attempt a 42-yard field goal attempt. Kicker Trey Smack made the 42-yard attempt, but Florida was whistled for an illegal substitution penalty, having 12 players on the field. A 10-second runoff was enforced on the penalty, ending the half, with UF taking just a 3-0 lead into halftime\n\nMissed opportunities hurting Florida football\n\nFlorida is still clinging to a 3-0 lead on Tennessee in the second quarter but some missed opportunities have hurt the Gators. The first game when Eugene Wilson III was stopped for a 1-yard loss on 4th-and-1 from Tennessee's 20-yard line. The second game when Florida quarterback Graham Mertz fumbled on a QB sneak from first-and-goal at the UT 1, with Tennessee recovering.

      "content": "Florida vs. Tennessee live stream, where to watch, TV channel, prediction, pick, spread, odds\nNo. 8 Tennessee returns home to face rival Florida after struggling to score in its two-game road trip to start SEC play.\n By Brandon Marcello \n13 hrs ago\n•\n4 min read\nGetty Images\n\nDid anyone expect Florida to be riding a wave of momentum and Tennessee be reeling heading into Saturday's annual rivalry game in the SEC? The Gators have bounced back nicely with coach Billy Napier on the hot seat, winning two straight -- both by double digits -- in must-have games against Mississippi State and UCF. A loss to the Knights last week would have most certainly sealed Napier's fate, but the Gators won 24-13 and now have some sense of hope heading into Knoxville this week.\n\nMeanwhile, Tennessee seems to have hit the floor with a thud on offense. The Volunteers haven't looked the part of the nation's most explosive offense in its first two SEC games – both on the road – averaging just over 19 points. The 19-14 loss at unranked Arkansas was not just disappointing but it also exposed the Vols' weaknesses, particularly after the Razorbacks installed a 3-2-6 defensive alignment package (only four plays) to slow the Vols, just as Oklahoma did a few weeks ago in the Sooners' 25-15 loss to the Vols.\n\nThe oddsmakers still favor Tennessee by two touchdowns against the Gators, but history hasn't been kind to the Vols in this spot. Florida is 17-2 in the last 19 matchups but has lost 10 of its last 11 games against top 25 teams.\n\nHow to watch Florida vs. Tennessee live\n\nDate: Saturday, Oct. 12 | Time: 7 p.m. ET\nLocation: Neyland Stadium – Knoxville, Tennessee\nTV: ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)\n\nFlorida vs. Tennessee: Need to know\n\nTennessee needs the offense to wake up: Two great defensive coordinators have out-coached Josh Heupel in the Vols' last two games. Arkansas' Travis Williams needed only four new plays in a 3-2-6 to slow the Vols, who were shut out in the first half last week. Tennessee managed only 76 yards in the first 30 minutes, the lowest total of the Heupel era. Now imagine what would have happened if the Vols didn't protect the football as well as they did last week (zero turnovers). Florida's defense is capable of keeping this game in the 20-point range, but the key here is Tennessee is back home for the first time in three weeks. It's obvious Heupel has more confidence as a play caller when redshirt freshman Nico Iamaleava is inside Neyland Stadium. The Vols averaged 63.7 points before the two-game road trip. They averaged 19.5 points in the 1-1 start in the SEC.\n\nGraham Mertz has been solid: If you haven't been paying attention to Florida since its blowout losses to Miami and Texas A&M at home, the quarterback situation has settled down between Graham Mertz and DJ Lagway, and the Gators look much more competent on offense. Mertz, whose up-and-down performances had soured many, actually leads the FBS in hitting 80% or more of his passes in the last three games. Two of those performances were against subpar defenses (Mississippi State and UCF), but the Gators' offense has regained some confidence. \n\nTennessee's defense is still elite: Don't let the loss at Arkansas fool you. The Volunteers still have one of the best defenses in the country. They gave up 430-plus yards against the Hogs, but only allowed 19 points and were mostly stout in the red zone (they also allowed a touchdown in the final 77 seconds to give the offense an opportunity to win the game). They have the nation's best defense on third downs (22.1% conversion rate), and they rank second in total defense (227.6 yards) and fourth in scoring (9.4). The Vols' defensive line is fantastic and should give the Florida offensive line fits.\n\nFlorida vs. Tennessee prediction, picks\n\nWill the real Tennessee offense please stand up? The Vols have struggled on the road offensively, scoring just 19.5 points in back-to-back road games in the SEC after opening the season at a blistering pace (63.7 ppg). The 19-14 loss at Arkansas was an eye opener for the Vols, who have struggled against 3-2-6 defenses of late. The good news for the Vols: Nico Iamaleava returns home to the safe confines of Neyland Stadium, where he is electric (and coach Josh Heupel has more confidence as a play-caller). Florida has some momentum with back-to-back wins against Mississippi State and UCF, but this is a sizable bump in competition. Graham Mertz has to play without throwing picks, which he has done well of late. The Vols are 13-4 against the spread in their last 17 home games as a double-digit favorite, but this is the largest spread as a favorite against the Gators in 30 years. The Vols bounce back with a vengeance on offense and cover. Pick: Tennessee -15.5\n\n\n\nDennis Dodd\n\t\nTom Fornelli\n\t\nChip Patterson\n\t\nShehan Jeyarajah\n\t\nDavid Cobb\n\t\nJerry Palm\n\t\nBrandon Marcello\n\t\nRichard Johnson\n\n\nUT -15.5\nFlorida\n\t\nTennessee\n\t\nFlorida\n\t\nTennessee\n\t\nTennessee\n\t\nTennessee\n\t\nTennessee\n\t\nTennessee\n\n\nSU\nTennessee\n\t\nTennessee\n\t\nTennessee\n\t\nTennessee\n\t\nFlorida\n\t\nTennessee\n\t\nTennessee\n\t\nFlorida\n\nWhich college football picks can you make with confidence in Week 7? Visit SportsLine to see which teams will win and cover the spread -- all from a proven computer model that has returned over $2,000 in profit since its inception -- and find out.",

The Vols have to bounce back off last week’s stunning loss at Arkansas and beat Florida for their looming showdown with No. 7 Alabama to have major significance or playoff implications. Florida is trying to get on a run after wins over Mississippi State and UCF with this an opportunity for the Gators to test themselves in the first of several games against ranked Southeastern Conference teams.\n\nKey matchup\n\nFlorida DL vs. Tennessee OTs. Gator DE Tyreak Sapp has 2 1/2 sacks, and tackle George Gumbs, who transferred to Florida from Northern Illinois, has collected four himself. Tennessee LT Lance Heard and RT Jack Campbell struggled against Arkansas as the Vols gave up four sacks and several hurries.\n\nPlayers to watch\n\nFlorida: WR Elijhah Badger. Arkansas threw for 297 yards against Tennessee, exposing vulnerabilities in the Vols’ secondary. If the Gators exploit those areas, Badger will be counted on to make something happen. He has caught 17 passes for 346 yards and two touchdowns this season.\n\nTennessee: RB Dylan Sampson. He has rushed for 12 touchdowns (2nd in FBS) and 589 yards (2nd in SEC, 14th in FBS) this season. When Sampson is running well, so does the Tennessee offense. The Gators struggled getting lined up against Mississippi State, which ran an up-tempo attack similar to Tennessee’s.\n\nFacts & figures\n\nRECOMMENDED•NJ.COM\n\nWhat channel is Florida vs. Tennessee game today (10/12/24)?

Craft was 23.\n\n“This young man fought so hard for his two and a half years,” Brown said. “The doctors told us he outlived what he should’ve. And he did it with the spirit, he did it with a smile on his face, he didn’t miss a meeting, he didn’t miss practice, he coached these other incredible young people.”\n\nUNC had honored Craft — who was diagnosed with a rare form of lung cancer in March 2022 — during Saturday’s football game, which also happened to be the team’s annual Cancer Awareness Game. Friends and family members wearing shirts bearing Craft’s name and number were recognized during an on-field ceremony.\n\nWide receiver J.J. Jones wore Craft’s jersey with his No. 13 and last name against the Yellow Jackets.\n\nBrown told reporters he didn’t learn of Craft’s death until after the game but sensed something had happened after sharing an emotional hug with Craft’s mother at the end of the first quarter.\n\n“I think the family feels the love and they’ll continue to feel the love,” Brown said. “What we’ve got to do is be strong, and pray for strength for us as leaders, to help these guys on the field and off the field. … So more than ever before I have got to step up and be stronger for them and make sure that I can help them manage the stuff and move forward in their lives.”\n\nUNC football also announced Craft’s death in a statement posted on social media, followed later by a tribute video to Craft’s memory. Additionally, the UNC men’s basketball team wore shirts bearing Craft’s name and number for its intrasquad scrimmage at the Smith Center following the football game, and had a pre-scrimmage moment of silence in Craft’s honor.\n\nCraft, from Sumter, South Carolina, played in seven games at receiver and on special teams as a true freshman in 2020, and four games in 2021 before his diagnosis. Still, he had remained present and close to the program.\n\n“Tylee meant so much to so many and affected us in ways we’ll always be thankful for,\" the football program's statement said. “He was 1-of-1 and, while he won’t be with us in body, he’ll be watching over us with his endearing smile and endless positivity.”\n\n___\n\nAP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-football-poll and https://apnews.com/hub/college-football.

This year has been truly amazing. I got to play Glinda in the ‘Wicked’ movie. It’s awesome, because I’m such a theater kid. And it’s every theater kid’s dream to be Glinda or Elphaba. Well, it’s every theater kids dream to lose their virginity. But their second dream is of course to be in ‘Wicked.'”\n\nRelated Stories\nVIP+\n‘Until Dawn,’ ‘Silent Hill 2’ Remakes Show Relevancy of Retreading IP\nWondery Sets New True-Crime Podcast ‘Kill List’ About Murder for Hire (EXLUSIVE)\n\nRecalling her last time hosting, the pop star said, “The last time I hosted was in 2016, right on the verge of electing our first female president so I guess second time’s the charm.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nGrande, known for her phenomenal vocal range, poked fun at her singing gravitas, saying, “I just want to make one thing clear; I am just hosting. I’m not going to make this about me. I’m just going to have fun, take it easy, and keep it low key.\n\nFrom offstage, Grande was handed a microphone. “Oh, what’s this?” Then she launched into song, saying, “I’m not going to sing my favorite notes…I’m not going to do my impressions…” Then the two-time Grammy winner flexed her vocal range doing impressions of Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus and Gwen Stefani, with a spot-on take of Stefani’s singing No Doubt’s 1995 hit, “Don’t Speak. “I promised I won’t do a lift,” said Grande, as she was hoisted into the air and joined by a glamorous chorus line clad in suits.\n\nBowen Yang joined Grande onstage wearing the classic “Wizard of Oz” costume of Glinda. “Bowen, didn’t anybody tell you? We cut the ‘Wicked’ sketch.”\n\n“Oh, that’s okay,” said Yang. “I didn’t really want to do it anyway.” Grande sang back, “Great, and this isn’t a wand, it’s a flask,” she said, yanking the top of Yang’s pink Glinda wand.\n\n“I’m not gonna do a duet tonight,” she sang, “So please don’t bring out Stevie Nicks! And the last thing I’m gonna do is bring out some hot dancers to do some insanely high kicks!” Grand was joined then by a glamorous chorus line clad in sparkly suits.\n\nIn another short sketch, she played Celine Dion and spoofed the singer’s surprising promo for the NFL last week. This time, however, Grande’s Dion sang about the violent, bone-crunching UFC fighting in a spoof of “It’s All Coming Back to Me Now.”\n\nRead More About:\nAriana Grande, Saturday Night Live, Wicked\nJump To Comments\nMore from Variety\nOasis ‘Reunites’ on ‘SNL’ and Promises to Not Break Up Before Their Tour: ‘It’s Not a Hard No, It’s a Maybe’\nCloud Adoption Key to Media Business Exploiting AI\nSebastian Stan on ‘Losing Sleep’ Over Not Resembling Donald Trump, ‘That’ Scene From ‘The Apprentice’ and ‘F—ing Hard’ Action Movies: ‘Tom Cruise Is Not a Normal Person’\n‘Alien: Romulus’ Sets Date for Digital and Physical Releases\nWhat Lionsgate’s Partnership Deal With Runway Means\nMark Harmon on Returning to ‘NCIS: Origins’ After Choosing to Leave Franchise — and Why His Son Isn’t Portraying Young Gibbs in Prequel\n\n0 Comments\nComments are moderated.

(Rosalind O’Connor/NBC via AP)\n\nBY  ANDREW DALTON\nUpdated 7:22 AM GMT+2, October 13, 2024\nShare\n\nAriana Grande took the New York 30 Rock stage at “Saturday Night Live” for the third time as host and found herself in familiar circumstances.\n\n“The last time I hosted was in 2016, and we were right on the verge of electing our first female president,” the 31-year-old singer and actor said in her monologue. “So, I guess, second time’s the charm?”\n\nGrande, who first hosted in 2014, was doing it for the first time without also serving as musical guest — a role that fell to Stevie Nicks — and promised not to sing, before breaking into a song.\n\nThe theme continued as she vowed during the tune not to do her signature impressions of Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus and Gwen Stefani, before throwing out a bit of each. She would do a much longer version of Celine Dion in a sketch later in the show.\n\nGrande hosted in promotion of her movie musical “Wicked,” the “Wizard of Oz” prequel set to be released next month.\n\nShe said playing the good witch Glinda as she does in the film is the dream of every theater kid like her, after “losing their virginity.”\n\nGrande’s episode comes amid a ratings spike for the sketch institution, likely brought on by its 50th season, and election season. Last month’s season premiere brought in the most viewers since 2020.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n'SNL' 50th season premiere gets more than 5M viewers\nJean Smart, Ariana Grande, Michael Keaton among hosts for 'SNL' season 50\n'SNL' launches 50th season: All you need to know\n\nJust as in the first two episodes of the new season, Maya Rudolph played Vice President Kamala Harris in the night’s cold open, leading a group of former cast members returning as guest stars, including Andy Samberg as Harris’ husband Doug Emhoff and Dana Carvey as President Joe Biden.\n\nThey teamed up for an election edition of “The Family Feud,” taking on team Trump.\n\nKenan Thompson, the longest-tenured cast member in the show’s history who began in 2003, reprised his long-running role as “Feud” host Steve Harvey and asked Rudolph-as-Harris about her recent media blitz.\n\n“It’s been a hell of a week,” she said. “I went on Howard Stern to reach the horny cab drivers, I went on ‘The View’ for the horny moms, and I also went on the podcast ‘Call Her Daddy’ because I have a message for young women: You need to go to the ballot box if you want the government out of your ballot box.”\n\nCurrent cast member James Austin Johnson returned as Donald Trump, saying his opponent is “going to be horrible at this game. She’s a very low IQ person. The whole world is laughing at her because they don’t respect her.”\n\nThe 76-year-old Nicks was the “SNL” musical guest for the first time in more than 40 years. She opened with her brand new single, “The Lighthouse,” but the look of the performance was classic Stevie, with an abundance of rings and scarves and the singer draped in black. For her second song, she reached back with “Edge of Seventeen” from 1981.\n\nMichael Keaton is set to host next week with musical guest Billie Eilish. John Mulaney and Chappell Roan are set for the following Saturday.\n\nThe onset of season 50 already has brought reflection and nostalgia in many forms, including “Saturday Night,” a movie comedy dramatizing the minutes before the first episode of the Lorne Michaels-helmed sketch institution on Oct. 11, 1975.\n\nA three-hour primetime special on Feb. 16 is set to serve as the official 50th season celebration.\n\n  \nby Taboola\nSuggested For You\nMassachusetts pharmacist gets up to 15 years in prison for meningitis outbreak deaths\nErvaar hansgrohe producten zelf\nHansgrohe\n:\nAdvertisement\nWoman who stabbed classmate to please Slender Man files third release request\nMoreno's abortion comment rattles debate in expensive Senate race in Republican-leaning Ohio\nIowa teen who killed teacher must serve 35 years before being up for parole\nSkip Ad\nDiscover\nWisconsin regulators file complaint against judge who left court to arrest a hospitalized defendant\nWisconsin judicial regulators have filed a misconduct complaint against a Dane County judge who allegedly left court to try to arrest a hospitalized defendant and got into an argument with another defendant.\nAP News\nTexas man held in Las Vegas in deadly 2020 Nevada-Arizona shooting rampage pleads guilty\nOne of three people jailed in Las Vegas following a deadly Nevada and Arizona shooting rampage in Thanksgiving 2020 has pleaded guilty ahead of trial.\nAP News\n52-jarige vrouw met een babygezicht.

No, I’m not going to make this about me, I’m just gonna have fun, take it easy and, yeah, just keep it lowkey,” Grande said.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n“I’m gonna keep it lowkey tonight / promise I’m not gonna sing,” the singer-songwriter begins with an improptu ballad that soon transforms into a full-blown, boisterous cabaret-style number, featuring her seamlessly jumping from her signature Britney Spears impression to an homage of Gwen Stefani’s vocals set to the tune of No Doubt’s “Don’t Speak.”\n\nGrande also promises not to talk about Wicked, unexpectedly running into a misplaced Bowen Yang in full Glinda drag. Then comes a particularly campy high-kick line, as Grande abandons all “lowkey” qualities for her renowned voice to shine.\n\n“If you’re looking for a diva, don’t look over here,” she concludes, tongue-in-cheek.\n\nSure, Grande, sure.\n\nREAD MORE ABOUT:\nARIANA GRANDE\nBOWEN YANG\nOPENING MONOLOGUE\nSATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\nSNL\nWICKED\n Comments\nSubscribe to Deadline\n\nGet our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.\n\nSign Up\nNo Comments\nSubmit a comment\n\nComments On Deadline Hollywood are monitored.

The song continues:\n\n“At the Marriott, Googling Domingo / Just to make sure he’s not psycho\n\nBut he’s actually a doctor, and randomly a model / And he volunteers with weird sick animals.”\n\n“The next day, she said nothing happened / they talked all night about you, Matthew\n\nBut then at brunch, she just starts crying / We ask her why, she says she just so tired.”\n\nWhen Domingo (Marcello Hernandez) shows up to sing a verse, he has some bad news: Yes, the two definitely did hook up.\n\nGrande, who was last on SNL as musical guest in March, channelled another singer later in the show: Céline Dion.\n\nTRENDING\nWorst Coachella Headliner Ever: Trump Threatens to Withhold Aid to California, Let It Burn\nTrump Calls Kamala Harris ‘Retarded’ During a Donor Dinner: Report\nHow the Marley Brothers Keep Their Father’s Legacy Alive\n'SNL' Cold Open: Team Harris, Trump Compete in Family Feud\n\nIn making a promo for an upcoming UFC event–playing off of Dion’s Sunday Night Football promo–Grande sings about elbows, kicks and punches to the tune of “It’s All Coming Back to Me Now.”\n\n“It’s all coming back to me…but maybe not to them because of the concussions, no?” she says, imitating Dion, in between verses.\n\nIN THIS ARTICLE:\nAriana Grande,\nCeline Dion,\nSabrina Carpenter,\nSaturday Night Live,\nSNL\nTV & MOVIES\nTV & MOVIES NEWS",

Well, it’s every theater kid’s dream to lose their virginity, but their second dream is to be in Wicked,” joked Grande, since band geeks usually take the crown as the horny clique. While she wasn’t the musical guest of the evening, she sang as Britney Spears and Miley Cyrus, trying to keep it lowkey— singing is lowkey for her, okay! It would be criminal if she didn’t do her Rolodex of impressions — it’s hard not to remember her Jennifer Lawrence sketch from her last hosting gig.

Sign up here.\n\nBOULDER, Colo. (AP) — Colorado two-way star Travis Hunter left the Buffaloes’ 31-28 loss to No. 18 Kansas State late in the second quarter Saturday night after a right shoulder injury on a 14-yard reception.\n\nThree other Buffs receivers were injured in the game: speedster Jimmy Horn Jr. (apparent ankle), Omarion Miller (left ankle) and Terrell Timmons Jr. (unspecified).\n\nCoach Deion Sanders had no update after the game on any of the four except to say Miller was in a walking boot.\n\n“But I haven’t gotten an update on those young men,” Sanders said. “Hopefully they can get back at it, but we’re not going to rush them. Their safety and their health is much more important than this game.”\n\nThe impact of their injuries was huge in a such a close game.\n\n“Certainly losing Travis and Jimmy and the others was tremendous,” Sanders said. “Because they’re a vital part of our team, a vital part of our identity, they’re a vital part of who we are. That took a lot out of us. But other guys had the opportunity to step up and they did.”\n\nShedeur Sanders still threw for 388 yards and three touchdowns with one interception on 34-of-40 passing.\n\nRELATED STORIES\nPowered by candy, music and big plays, Colorado 2-way star Travis Hunter in mix of Heisman race\nSanders reminds team not to be surprised by 4-1 start as Colorado prepares for No. 18 Kansas State\nDeion Sanders and the scuffling Colorado Buffaloes travel to Fort Collins to face Colorado State\n\n“I never thought four receivers would get hurt in one game. That’s just ridiculous,” the quarterback said. “But things happen. Life happens. So, we’ve just got to roll with it and do what we’ve got to do for next week.”\n\nThe Buffaloes (4-2, 2-1 Big 12) missed Henry more on defense than they did on offense.\n\nThe Buffaloes allowed two touchdowns and a field goal on their first three defensive series without their superstar defensive back, falling behind 24-14. With Hunter back on the sideline for the second half in support of his teammates, Colorado rallied to take a 28-24 lead with 3:12 remaining but then gave up a 50-yard touchdown less than a minute later. After that, their offense turned the ball over on downs.\n\nBefore sustaining the shoulder injury, Hunter was on track for his usual workload — a whopping 124 snaps per game — as he was on the field for all but one of Colorado’s first 45 combined offensive and defensive snaps.\n\nOn the play he got hurt, Hunter hauled in Shedeur Sanders’ pass on a crossing pattern for a 14-yard gain at midfield and ran full speed into safety Daniel Cobbs. He held onto the ball but signaled to the sideline that he needed a sub. On the broadcast, ESPN said the medical team was evaluating Hunter’s right shoulder.\n\nLast season Hunter missed three games with a lacerated liver after taking a hard hit against Colorado State. But Hunter has rarely taken off a snap this season and is in the thick of the Heisman Trophy race.\n\nHunter had three catches for 26 yards and one tackle Saturday night before leaving. That gave him 49 receptions for 587 yards and two touchdowns on the season along with 16 tackles, two interceptions and a forced fumble on defense.\n\n___\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "content": "Colorado's Travis Hunter exits game with injury vs. Kansas State\nBuffaloes two-way star walked to the locker room after shoulder pain\nJason Jones | 8 Hours Ago\nKris Miller/SI\nIn this story:\nColorado Buffaloes\n\nColorado Buffaloes' two-way star Travis Hunter exited the game against No. 18 Kansas State after suffering a shoulder injury late in the first half. The Heisman hopeful, who has been a vital part of Colorado’s success this season, left the field during a timeout with about six minutes remaining before halftime. This marked the longest period of time Hunter has been off the field this season, as his versatility as both a wide receiver and cornerback has been crucial to the Buffaloes.\n\n\nHunter, who was receiving attention from Colorado’s athletic training staff on the sideline, appeared in discomfort as they evaluated his shoulder. After a brief assessment on the field, he was escorted to the locker room for further evaluation, leaving Colorado fans holding their breath. His presence on the field has been a game-changer for the Buffaloes throughout the season, making his exit a significant moment in the contest.\n\nDeion Sanders calls out ESPN's Pat McAfee over not favoring Travis Hunter for Heisman\n\nAt the time of Hunter's departure, the game between Colorado and Kansas State was tied at 7-7, and the Buffaloes faced a tough challenge against a top-20 opponent. Losing Hunter's abilities on both sides of the ball could prove to be a major blow for Colorado, which has leaned on his playmaking ability in both defensive and offensive schemes.\n\n\nHunter’s injury and the timing of his exit will likely be a critical storyline as the game progresses. His return status remains uncertain, and Colorado will need to adjust without their standout player as they head into halftime tied with Kansas State in a hard-fought battle.\n\nThis story is developing.\n\n\n\n\nPublished 8 Hours Ago|Modified Oct 12, 2024\nJASON JONES",

      "content": "Notre Dame vs. Stanford: Key Takeaways from a Dominant Victory\nNotre Dame easily disposed of Stanford to improve to 5-1 on the year\nNick Shepkowski | 12 Hours Ago\nNotre Dame wide receiver Jayden Thomas (83), wide receiver Jayden Harrison (2) and wide receiver Kris Mitchell (10) celebrate a touchdown scored by Thomas during a NCAA college football game between Notre Dame and Stanford at Notre Dame Stadium on Saturday, Oct. 12, 2024, in South Bend. / MICHAEL CLUBB/SOUTH BEND TRIBUNE / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images\nIn this story:\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish\nStanford Cardinal\n\nNotre Dame moved to 5-1 on the season Saturday after dominating Stanford in a 49-7 victory. Despite shaky first possessions on both offense and defense, Notre Dame was in complete control the rest of the way.\n\nStanford isn't going to win a ton of games this year but Notre Dame did to it what it should do to inferior opponents.\n\nHere are instant thoughts following Notre Dame's dominating takedown of the Cardinal on Saturday.\n\nNotre Dame Football: Howard Cross Comes Alive\n\nDefensive tackle Howard Cross III came into the year as a preseason All-American. He played well against Texas A&M but had struggles against Northern Illinois and didn't look his normal self for parts early on. Saturday was his best game of the year to date, recording a pair of first half sacks, four tackles, and being a menace in the Stanford backfield all day. Cross refinding himself is a huge development for Notre Dame's already strong defense.\n\nNotre Dame Football: Best Offensive Showing to Date\n\nIt didn't match the 66 points it scored against Purdue, but Saturday's win was Notre Dame's most complete showing offensively to date.\n\nNotre Dame's offense averaged over 10 yards per pass and over five yards per carry. It was against Stanford, I get that. It's what a top 10 team is supposed to do against Stanford though and Notre Dame did exactly that.\n\nNotre Dame Football: Riley Leonard's Best Game to Date\nOct 12, 2024; South Bend, Indiana, USA; Notre Dame Fighting Irish quarterback Riley Leonard (13) throws a pass for a touchdown as Stanford Cardinal safety Mitch Leigber (32) defends in the second quarter at Notre Dame Stadium. / Matt Cashore-Imagn Images\n\nIf you're Notre Dame you have to be thrilled with what Riley Leonard did on Saturday. The Fighting Irish quarterback completed 16 of 22 pass attempts, averaged more than 10 yards per attempt, and ran for 31 more yards which included a touchdown. Perhaps my favorite part of Leonard's game Saturday was his distribution while throwing. Nine different players caught passes for Notre Dame which speaks to the ability to mix things up - even if one was on an oddly deflected ball that wound up in the hands of center Pat Coogan.\n\nThere was more play action than we have previously seen this year and although Leonard's runs didn't end with massive yardage, multiple were key in extending drives and getting points on the board.\n\nSaturday was a big step in the right direction for Notre Dame's offense, Leonard included.\n\nNotre Dame Football: Dominating Defense\n\nStanford had a great opening series as it went 63 yards in nine plays to take an early 7-0 advantage. From there, Notre Dame's defense was in charge, allowing just 137 yards of offense the entire rest of the afternoon. If you want to take it a step further, 32 more of those yards came on Stanford's last drive of the first half as Notre Dame was playing in a safer defense, willfully giving up yards underneath.\n\nPressure came regularly for Notre Dame, as it did stopping the run. It was a great showing overall by the Notre Dame defense.\n\nNotre Dame Football: Irish are Legit Good Football Team\nNotre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love runs into the end zone for a touchdown during a NCAA college football game between Notre Dame and Stanford at Notre Dame Stadium on Saturday, Oct. 12, 2024, in South Bend. / MICHAEL CLUBB/SOUTH BEND TRIBUNE / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images\n\nYou can sit and say \"it's Stanford\" all you want, but Notre Dame did exactly what a very good football team is supposed to do to a team like the Cardinal. It flat-out dominated.\n\nNotre Dame's defense was dominant all afternoon after the first possession and the offense was lights out aside from some early self-infliction.\n\nThis was the look of a top ten team. It might not be built like much of the rest of the top 10-15 teams in the nation, but it certainly has the talent to be one when it performs like it did Saturday.\n\nNotre Dame Football on Sports Illustrated\nNotre Dame vs. Stanford In-Game Blog\nPublished 12 Hours Ago|Modified Oct 12, 2024\nNICK SHEPKOWSKI",

So even if Stanford, a school on the Pacific Coast, is now playing in the Atlantic Coast Conference, it can keep its rivalry with a school 2,300 miles away (which is closer than any other ACC team aside from Cal) going thanks to a scheduling agreement between Notre Dame and a conference it refuses to join!\n\nCollege football in 2024, ladies and gentlemen. Anyway, Stanford is making one of what will be many trips east to face No. 11 Notre Dame in a game that's always big, no matter the national stakes. Still, it's pretty important for Notre Dame to get a win here, as home losses to Northern Illinois don't leave you with much margin of error when you're trying to keep your College Football Playoff hopes alive.\n\nAs for Stanford, things have been up and down this season. The Cardinal began life in the ACC with a road win over Syracuse, but have followed up with consecutive losses to Clemson and Virginia Tech, getting outscored 71-21 in the process. They'll have to play much better football this weekend if they want to avoid a similar result.\n\nHow to watch Notre Dame vs. Stanford live\n\nDate: Saturday, Oct. 12 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ET\nLocation: Notre Dame Stadium -- South Bend, Indiana\nTV: NBC | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)\n\nNotre Dame vs. Stanford: Need to know\n\nNotre Dame has won 19 straight home games against ACC opponents: My mind still hasn't totally processed that Stanford is now an ACC opponent, but it is, and that's not good news for the Cardinal considering how ACC teams typically fare in South Bend. The Irish haven't lost at home to an ACC team since falling to Virginia Tech during the 2016 season. However, they have lost two of their last three home games against Stanford! The Cardinal beat the Irish in 2016 and in their last meeting at Notre Dame Stadium in 2022.\n\nStanford has lost eight straight road games against ranked opponents: You don't see teams typically perform well on the road against ranked teams, but you don't see a lot of eight-game losing streaks either. The Cardinal haven't beaten a ranked team on the road since upsetting No. 14 USC 42-28 in 2021. Making matters worse, the eight losses since haven't exactly been competitive affairs. Stanford's lost them by an average of 28.9 points per game.\n\nStanford should have QB Ashton Daniels back: Ashton Daniels suffered an injury late in Stanford's loss to Clemson and missed last week's game against Virginia Tech. He's expected to return for this game, which will help Stanford's cause. Daniels' dual-threat ability makes the Cardinals offense more difficult to defend, and odds are they'll need his legs to extend drives against a strong Irish defense.\n\nNotre Dame vs. Stanford prediction, picks\n\nI'm taking the Cardinal to cover the spread, but it's not due to faith in Stanford as much as the style of play. Notre Dame's offense is heavily reliant on the ground game, and quarterback Riley Leonard is the team's leading rusher. Stanford isn't likely to try to air it out against this Irish defense, so I don't know that either team will be able to pull away from the other. At least, not enough to cover 23.5 points. Pick: Stanford +23.5\n\n\n\nDennis Dodd\n\t\nTom Fornelli\n\t\nChip Patterson\n\t\nShehan Jeyarajah\n\t\nDavid Cobb\n\t\nJerry Palm\n\t\nBrandon Marcello\n\t\nRichard Johnson\n\n\nND -23.5\nNotre Dame\n\t\nStanford\n\t\nStanford\n\t\nNotre Dame\n\t\nStanford\n\t\nNotre Dame\n\t\nStanford\n\t\nStanford\n\n\nSU\nNotre Dame\n\t\nNotre Dame\n\t\nNotre Dame\n\t\nNotre Dame\n\t\nNotre Dame\n\t\nNotre Dame\n\t\nNotre Dame\n\t\nNotre Dame\n\nWhich college football picks can you make with confidence in Week 7? Visit SportsLine to see which teams will win and cover the spread -- all from a proven computer model that has returned over $2,000 in profit since its inception -- and find out.",

I did two 20-milers. That was the longest I did, but I like training in Boston, because it's so hilly. I think it prepares for something a little flatter,\" said runner Riley Brook.  \n\nThe marathon steps off just after 7 a.m. Sunday at Grant Park, where runners will begin the 26.2 mile trek across the city, weaving through 29 neighborhoods, where they will be able to soak in some of the most picturesque landmarks Chicago has to offer.\n\nCheering them on, an estimated 1.7 million spectators that are expected to line up along the route.\n\n\"I'm a little anxious. I'm a little nervous. First time. My training went well, but it could've went better,\" said runner Ruben Robelin.\n\nHis 5-year-old son on the other hand – couldn't be more prepared for when he takes his spot in the cheering squad, already cheering \"Let's go daddy!\" before the marathon even started.\n\nDanielle Xu said her training fell off a bit because she got married this year, \"but hopefully it was enough to run the race tomorrow.\"\n\nIt's also going be Lauren Strandberg's first marathon. The Norwood Park woman had no shortage of obstacles getting to this point, after being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 2020. She thought the chronic disease was going to sideline her from ever running again, but on Sunday she's defying the odds.\n\n\"It's just incredible that I can work my way up from running 3 miles to here I am running 26 miles,\" she said. \n\nWith all the excitement that's building, there's also that not-so-excited part to talk about – street closures, which will impact much of the city.\n\nWhile some of the street closures around the start and finish line are already in place, restrictions along a bulk of the marathon route will go into effect Sunday morning.\n\nStreet closures in the Grant Park area  began on Monday, September 30 with the closure of Balbo from Columbus to DuSable Lake Shore Drive at 10 a.m. Additional Street closures for race day at the start/finish line area can be expected through the weekend, including:\n\nWednesday, October 9: Jackson Dr. from Columbus Dr. to DuSable Lake Shore Drive will close at 10 a.m. and reopen on Monday, October 14 at 6 a.m.\nThursday, October 10: Balbo Dr. from Michigan Ave. to Columbus Dr. will close at 4 a.m. and reopen on Monday, October 14 at 3 p.m.\nThursday, October 10: Columbus Dr. from Ida B.

Read on and we'll show you how to watch Chicago Marathon live streams from anywhere with a VPN — and potentially for FREE.\n\nCHICAGO MARATHON LIVE STREAMS: START TIME, TV CHANNELS\n\nThe 2024 Chicago Marathon takes place today (Sunday, Oct. 13)\n► Start time — 7:20 a.m. CST local / 8:20 a.m. ET / 5:20 a.m. PT / 1:20 p.m. BST / 11:20 p.m. AEDT\n► U.S. — NBC Chicago (FREE STREAM)\n► Spain — RTVE (FREE STREAM)\n► U.K. — Discovery Plus\n► Can/Aus — FloTrack\n► Watch anywhere — Try NordVPN 100% risk free\n\nThis year's edition of the 47-year-old event is going to be tinged with sadness, but will also be a celebration of the late, great Kelvin Kiptum. Last year he set a remarkable world record of 2:00:35 on this course, but died in a tragic car crash earlier this year. Organizers plan to honor Kiptum today by offering each runner a memorial sticker that can be added to their bibs.\n\nThe elite runners will need to go some to challenge the course records set by Kiptum and Sifan Hassan in 2023, but there's a strong field preparing to do battle on both men's and women's sides.\n\nKenyans have won the last two men's races — today's favorite Vincent Ngetich and countrymen Amos Kipruto and Daniel Ebenyo and will all be hoping to make it three from three. Ethiopia's Birhanu Legese and Amedework Walelegn are the men most likely to stop them.\n\nIn the absence of Hassan, there's a decent chance we'll see the first American female champion for almost two decades with Keira D'Amato, Betsy Saina, Sara Hall and Emma Bates all looking in threatening form. Ruth Chepngetich and Sutsume Asefa Kebede will also inevitably be there or there abouts when the runners cross the line in Grant Park later today.\n\nYou'll find a full race day schedule at the bottom of this page.
