I knew going into this game that these guys were going to put up a fight. You've seen at times when you let a team hang around like that you get exactly what happened tonight. It sounds incredible to say, but I think that was the best thing that could have ever happened to us. To be up like that and have it start to go the other way, then show the resiliency to make plays at the end.\"\n \n\"Luke Altmyer continues to be so impressive in plus situations with Pat Bryant. On the defensive side we got banged up, Xavier Scott hurt himself in pregame and I don't think it's going to affect him more than a couple of days. Then his backup Tyler Strain got banged up during the game, so Tyson Rooks came in. There were a lot of guys stepping up with the way the game played out. I thought Dylan Rosiek was great.\"\n \n\"I called it when they won the coin toss. I told Tanner Arkin I wanted to keep our defense on the sideline and go through some calls. I told the defense 'our offense is going to score and go for one, but when Purdue gets it if they score they're going to go for two.' We called their two-point play before our offense even stepped on the field. There was a calmness in our defensive staff with shooting Rosiek up the middle and if there's one guy who I know who's going to make that tackle it's him and he has plenty of them.\"\n \n\"I'm super excited, obviously this game this week means a lot for people. It honors a stadium being rededicated 100 years later than one day and a great player not just in Illinois history but college football history. To have the Big Ten working with us to give Michigan the opportunity to come here in this region. I think it's going to be special. Josh Whitman and I literally talked about this game within the first two days of meeting each other and talked about what was coming up.\"\n \n\"I'm just super excited for our guys, we'll take this one and recover with a lot of good preparation on Sunday putting this game to bed. We did enough bad things today to give them a game. Most games are lost before they're won, at halftime I told them the only way they get back in it is if we turn the ball over and give up big plays. Both of those things happened way too fast in the middle of the third quarter, so a lot to learn from but super excited to be where we are. I say 1-0 all the time, but to be 5-1 heading into this Michigan week with two ranked teams in Memorial Stadium is what it's all about.\"\n \nOn Luke Altmyer:\n\"Luke is so confident even during the coin toss in overtime he's looking at me calling it to go down by the student section because he wanted to be in that end zone. He's thinking a lot more than what's in front of him and that's the impressive part. He makes great plays with his head, his hands, his feet, and his touch on the ball. He does a really good job of coordinating out there on the field getting guys lined up. He's super impressive.\"\n \nOn David Olano:\n\"David is an extremely confident young man. I remember watching him kick in high school when he came here for camp. I was asking him where to spot the ball and he kept giving me the answer before I even asked him. That's what his mom and dad raised, he's a guy that's very confident and performs at a high level. When I come over and ask him before the game what's the number he can hit from, and he nails it right out the gate. I think the competition between him and Ethan Moczulski is good. There's a lot of college teams that would love to have one of our two guys. The good news is we got them both for now and it's a lot of fun to have them.\" \n \nOn Josh McCray:\n\"Josh was literally my first offer; I called him and offered him a scholarship, so he always means a lot to me. He's gone through so much that people don't have any idea about and he continues to persevere. Here's a guy his freshman year who ran for 700 yards and has a knee bruise that keeps him out of eight games his second year. He has a neck issue that takes him out for the season. He sees all these other running backs come in Kaden Feagin, Aidan Laughery, and Ca'Lil Valentine; everyone's writing about all those other guys and not him and he continues to persevere. It's a one-handed catch against Nebraska, a flat route today in the first half, a tough one-yard run near the end zone to score. He continues to battle through as a young man who lost his mom early in life and was raised by his grandma. Unfortunately, he lost her before I ever met him. He gets beat down but keeps getting back up so I couldn't be prouder of him today.\"\n\nLuke Altmyer\n\nOn how he remains calm:\n\"I have trust in the preparation and understanding what we're going to see from the defense and the red zone offense for these overtime situations. Whether it's running down field or putting the ball up in these situations, we practice it all the time. At the end of the day, it's about every guy doing their job.\"\n \nOn his thoughts when Purdue went for two in overtime:\n\"I have trust in my defense and we constantly practice these situations. It was so cool to see them do it in that fashion. I knew we had to create pressure and Dylan made an incredible sack.\"\n\nDylan Rosiek\n\nOn changes in the second half:\n\"The first half they ran a lot of what we expected. In the second half they went into plays that challenged our eyes. They're good scheme plays. We have to have our eyes in better places, we have to be able to adjust and be ready.\"\n\nOn the team's feelings going into the game:\n\"I think it was personal for a lot of guys on this team. Last year's game left a sour taste in our mouth, and obviously, the Cannon hasn't been to Champaign in a while. A lot of guys took it personally.\"\n\nPat Bryant\n\nOn how the offense responded on the final drive of regulation:\n\"It's a Big Ten game, no matter where you are playing or who you are playing, you must go out there and fight. Coach B told us to start fast and finish even stronger. That's what we went out there and did. I did not want anybody to have a sad face, and our emotions were up and down, but we did a great job keeping our composure.\"\n \nOn the offenses composure with Luke at QB:\n\"Luke does a great job, and his character has built so much being a starting quarterback in the Big Ten. Throughout the whole game, I never saw his facial expression change. I had a sad face because I felt like we were not playing good football, but he kept coming in and telling us to keep our composure. That's a huge goal for him, coming through the whole offensive sideline keeping our spirits high and him just having faith in us.\"\n\nJosh McCray\n\nOn his relationship with Coach Bielema:\n\"He's the one that recruited me. Knowing that he's got my back, and I've got his means a lot to me.\"\n\nOn what changed in the second half:\n\"I just relied on my rules and principles. I went back to doing what we do at practice each and every day.\"\n\nPrint Friendly Version\nSponsors\nTeam Statistics\nTeam Statistics\nGame Stats\tPUR\tILL\nTotal Yards\t536\t556\nPass Yards\t297\t379\nRushing Yards\t239\t177\nPenalty Yards\t6-38\t5-45\n1st Downs\t21\t28\n3rd Downs\t5-10\t8-12\n4th Downs\t0-1\t0-1\nTOP\t26:49\t33:11\nScoring Summary\n1ST QUARTER\n\n06:04 - ILL - Olano,David 30 yd field goal 8 plays, 51 yards, TOP 03:45\n\t0\t3\n\n00:10 - ILL - McCray,Josh 11 yd run (Olano,David kick), 8 plays, 73 yards, TOP 04:26\n\t0\t10\n2ND QUARTER\n\n05:41 - PUR - Porath,Spencer 22 yd field goal 9 plays, 74 yards, TOP 04:30\n\t3\t10\n\n01:56 - ILL - Franklin,Zakhari 8 yd pass from Altmyer,Luke (Olano,David kick) 9 plays, 75 yards, TOP 03:45\n\t3\t17\n\n00:19 - ILL - McCray,Josh 6 yd pass from Altmyer,Luke (Olano,David kick) 5 plays, 25 yards, TOP 01:34\n\t3\t24\n3RD QUARTER\n\n10:57 - ILL - Olano,David 49 yd field goal 9 plays, 44 yards, TOP 04:03\n\t3\t27\n\n07:43 - PUR - Edrine,Jahmal 53 yd pass from Browne,Ryan (Porath,Spencer kick) 6 plays, 85 yards, TOP 03:10\n\t10\t27\n\n07:35 - PUR - Heldt,Will 16 yd fumble recovery (Porath,Spencer kick)\n\t17\t27\n\n00:49 - PUR - Porath,Spencer 24 yd field goal 6 plays, 64 yards, TOP 02:35\n\t20\t27\n4TH QUARTER\n\n13:17 - ILL - Altmyer,Luke 13 yd run (Olano,David kick), 5 plays, 75 yards, TOP 02:32\n\t20\t34\n\n10:31 - PUR - Tibbs,Jaron 8 yd pass from Browne,Ryan (Klare,Max pass) 6 plays, 75 yards, TOP 02:46\n\t28\t34\n\n05:05 - ILL - McCray,Josh 3 yd run ( ), 10 plays, 75 yards, TOP 05:26\n\t28\t40\n\n01:35 - PUR - Mockobee,Devin 2 yd run (Porath,Spencer kick), 10 plays, 75 yards, TOP 03:30\n\t35\t40\n\n00:46 - PUR - Mockobee,Devin 13 yd pass from Browne,Ryan (Edrine,Jahmal pass) 3 plays, 43 yards, TOP 00:49\n\t43\t40\n\n00:00 - ILL - Olano,David 38 yd field goal 7 plays, 53 yards, TOP 00:42\n\t43\t43\nOT QUARTER\n\n00:00 - ILL - Bryant,Pat 25 yd pass from Altmyer,Luke (Olano,David kick) 1 plays, 25 yards, TOP 00:00\n\t43\t50\n\n00:00 - PUR - Branch,Arhmad 3 yd run ( ), 2 plays, 25 yards, TOP 00:00\n\t49\t50\nGame Leaders\nChoose a category:\nPassing Leaders\nRushing Leaders\nReceiving Leaders\nDefense Leaders\n#9 ALTMYER,LUKE\nCMP 20\nTD 3\nYDS 379\nINT 0\nPlayers Mentioned\n#9 LUKE ALTMYER\nQB 6' 2\" Junior\n#85 TANNER ARKIN\nTE 6' 4\" Junior\n#13 PAT BRYANT\nWR 6' 3\" Senior\n#17 COLLIN DIXON\nWR 6' 1\" Redshirt Freshman\n#3 KADEN FEAGIN\nRB 6' 3\" Sophomore\n#21 AIDAN LAUGHERY\nRB 5' 11\" Sophomore\n#6 JOSH MCCRAY\nRB 6' 1\" Junior\n#24 DAVID OLANO\nK 5' 11\" Sophomore\n#19 TYSON ROOKS\nWR 6' 4\" Sophomore\n#28 DYLAN ROSIEK\nLB 6' 1\" Junior\nSponsors",

      "content": "Purdue's Ryan Walters Says Going for 2-Point Conversion was Right Call vs. Illinois\nAfter scoring a touchdown in overtime, Purdue attempted a two-point conversion in an attempt to beat Illinois. It didn't work, but Ryan Walters says it was the right choice.\nDustin Schutte | 7 Hours Ago\nPurdue Boilermakers head coach Ryan Walters looks on during the fourth quarter / Jeff Hanisch-Imagn Images\nIn this story:\nPurdue Boilermakers\n\nKick the extra point and play another overtime session or go for a two-point conversion and end the game? That was the decision Purdue coach Ryan Walters faced after a Arhmad Branch scored in the first extra session to bring the Boilermakers within one point against Illinois on Saturday.\n\nWalters opted to go with the latter choice, quarterback Ryan Browne was sacked and the Fighting Illini escaped with a 50-49 victory in Champaign. Even though it didn't work, Walters said it was a decision he make again.\n\n\"I felt like offensively we were clicking,\" Walters said. \"The game is in control, in your hands, on that last play. So I made a decision to go for it, and I would not change that decision.\"\n\nPurdue was carrying a ton of momentum into overtime after overcoming a 27-3 lead in the third quarter. Browne — who got the start due to an injury to Hudson Card — had an incredible game, throwing for 297 yards and three touchdowns and rushing for 118 more yards.\n\nTight end Max Klare had 133 receiving yards and running back Devin Mockobee accounted for 102 yards and a touchdown. Jahmal Edrine, Jaron Tibbs and Mockobee all had touchdown catches in the game.\n\nAs well as the offense played, the defense failed to get stops regularly. Illinois finished the game with 556 yards and converted eight-of-12 attempts on third down. Purdue's saving grace was a scoop-and-score from rush end Will Heldt in the third quarter and a recovered onside kick late in the fourth.\n\nWalters felt like going for a two-point conversion would give his team the best opportunity to win because of Illinois' success offensively. It was a gutsy move, but in the midst of a 1-5 season, the Boilers had nothing to lose.\n\nRelated stories on Purdue football\n\nCJ MADDEN OUT FOR SEASON: Purdue rush end CJ Madden has been ruled out for the remainder of season.

      "content": "Purdue football vs Illinois grades: Boilermakers nearly pull off historic comeback\nNATHAN BAIRD   Indianapolis Star\n\nCHAMPAIGN, Ill. -- Purdue football showed second-half fight for the first time in weeks and put a nearly historic scare into No. 23 Illinois on Saturday.\n\nTrailing by 24 points at the half, Purdue took the lead with 1:27 to play in regulation but Illinois tied it and Purdue's two-point attempt after Illinois scored to overtime was stopped to give the Illini a 50-49 victory at Memorial Stadium. It was, without a doubt, the sort of performance which a previously reeling Boilermaker team can build on as it prepares for a tough stretch of games ahead.\n\nPurdue score: Illinois vs Purdue football live score updates today: Boilers down 40-28 in second half\n\nPurdue offense: B+\n\nPurdue was trailing 27-3 at the half as Ryan Browne, making his first start, gave it a one-dimensional offense, but that is actually one more dimension than we'd seen for the past four games. There were some of those big mistakes; a dropped deep pass, pre-snap penalties and field goals after first-and-goal scenarios.\n\nBut Browne added another dimension in the second half and finished 18-of-26 for 297 yards with 3 touchdowns and no interceptions and rushed for 118 yards on 17 carries. Purdue took a 43-40 lead late in the fourth quarter and the offense was more than good enough to win despite the 50-49 overtime loss.\n\nPurdue defense: C-\n\nStill produced some big moments, yet still too volatile. Will Heldt's scoop-and-score off Nyland Green's strip-sack provided both the game-changing play and complementary football which have been lacking throughout the losing streak. Holding Illinois to a long field goal into the wind coming out of halftime set the stage for the attempted rally which followed.\n\nAllowed way too many explosive plays between run and pass and for the second straight week, poor tackling contributed directly to several of those. Take even one of those off the board and perhaps this game has a different outcome.\n\nAnd, of course, allowing Illinois to go 53 yards in the final 34 seconds of regulation to set up the game-tying field goal can't happen. Then the Illini scored easily on the first drive of overtime for the winning margin.\n\nPurdue special teams: C+\n\nFor the second straight week, a big gaffe leads directly to an opponent's touchdown. This week it was the inexplicable decision to allow a kickoff to land in play, with Illinois recovered and used to take a 24-3 lead into halftime. Keeland Crimmins keeps punting well, and Spencer Porath has become automatic from short range since opening his career with a miss. This phase cannot give away touchdowns, though. Neither of the other phases can overcome that handicap right now.\n\nThe successful onside kick, however, put the Boilermakers in position to win the game.\n\nPurdue coaching: B-\n\nWalters took on an even bigger portion of the offense, and you can't argue with the results. Not crazy about that failed fourth-and-1 pass call early when the rushing game had been rolling. Also not sure about the choice to go for 2 in the fourth quarter in an eight-point game, even if it went in Purdue's favor. But the reverse flea-flicker was well set up and well-executed.\n\nPurdue's staff needed to stop the free fall and establish some hope that more wins are attainable this season. Mission accomplished, even if a cleaner performance would have already secured that win on Saturday.\n\nPlay of the game\n\nLeland Smith recovered an onside kick at the Illinois 43-yard line with 1:27 to play in regulation to set up Purdue's go-ahead touchdown.\n\nPlayer of the game\n\nBrowne accounted for 415 all-purpose yards, made good decisions and capitalized on big-play opportunities.\n\n \n ",

(AP) Luke Altmyer threw a 25-yard touchdown pass in overtime to Pat Bryant, and Dylan Rosiek sacked Purdue's Ryan Browne on a 2-point conversion attempt to give No. 23 Illinois a 50-49 victory Saturday.\n\nIllinois (5-1, 2-1 Big Ten) had lost four straight and seven of its last eight against Purdue (1-5, 0-3). The Illini hadn’t beaten the Boilermakers at Memorial Stadium since 2010.\n\nIllinois’ David Alano made a 38-yard field goal as time expired to tie it at 43 after Purdue rallied to take the lead for the first time.\n\nAhrmad Branch, on his only carry of the day, scored on a 3-yard run in OT for the Boilermakers.\n\nPurdue coach Ryan Walters said he went for the 2-point conversion in OT “because we were in control of the game at that point. We clawed back in the game, something we hadn’t done this season, and I wanted to give us a chance to win. I hate losing.”\n\nAltmyer completed 20 of 34 passes for 379 yards and three touchdowns. Josh McCray ran for 78 yards and two TDs and caught a scoring pass. Bryant caught four passes for 104 yards.\n\n“We did enough bad things to give them the game,” Illinois coach Bret Bielema said. “If you let a team stick around like that, that’s what happens. I still think we’re a good team knocking on the door of doing something cool.”\n\nBrowne, a redshirt freshman making his first career start with Hudson Card sidelined by a concussion, rushed for 118 yards on 17 carries and completed 18 of 26 passes for 297 yards and three TDs after throwing for just 9 yards in the first half.\n\nMax Klare caught six passes for 133 yards for Purdue. Devin Mockobee ran for 102 yards on 11 carries.\n\nDown 27-3 at halftime, Purdue launched a comeback.\n\n“We executed. We didn't panic,” Walters said.\n\nThe Boilermakers scored two TDs in eight seconds on 53-yard pass from Browne to Jahmal Edrine and a sack of Altmyer by Nyland Green that caused a fumble that Will Heldt returned 16 yards for TD.\n\nAfter Browne threw a 62-yard strike to Klare on a double-reverse flea flicker, a 24-yard field goal by Spencer Porath made it 27-20. Altmyer ended Purdue’s surge with a 13-yard TD run early in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Boilermakers responded with an 8-yard TD pass from Browne to Jaron Tibbs and a 2-point conversion pass from Browne to Klare, but McCray scored on a 3-yard run to make it 40-28.\n\nPurdue cut the lead to 40-35 with 1:35 left on a 2-yard TD run by Mockobee.\n\nAfter Ben Freehill recovered an onside kick, the Boilermakers scored again on a 13-yard pass from Brown to Mockobee and a 2-point conversion pass from Browne to Edrine with 46 seconds left to move in front for the first time at 43-40.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nIllinois: Now that the Illini have vanquished the Boilermakers, the biggest thorn in their side over the past several years, they can focus on back-to-back huge Big Ten games to end the month. They’ll host No. 24 Michigan next week in the culmination of a season-long celebration of Memorial Stadium’s 100th anniversary and travel to No. 3 Oregon the following week.\n\nPurdue: The Boilermakers dropped their fifth straight after a season-opening win over Indiana State, and the Boilermakers have to go up against three of the country’s top four teams (Oregon, Oho State and Penn State) in the next four games.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nBeating one of the country’s worst teams by just one point in overtime shouldn’t propel Illinois higher in the AP Top 25. But the Illini shouldn’t drop, either, because they did what they needed to do against a foe that was desperate for a win.\n\nTOP RUSHER OUT\n\nIllinois rushing leader Kaden Feagin missed the game because of a hyperextended left leg, suffered in practice during the week. Bielema said Feagan will be out “for a little bit.” Feagin had gained 306 yards on 67 carries and run for three touchdowns in Illinois' first five games.\n\n---\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "content": "Illinois vs Purdue score today: Recap, highlights from wild Week 7 game\nWES HUETT ,  DAVE EMINIAN   Peoria Journal Star\nShow Caption\n\nThe nationally ranked Illinois Fighting Illinisurvived the Purdue Boilermakers, 50-49, in overtime to win the Week 7 college football game at Memorial Stadium.\n\nPurdue (1-5) gave the Illini everything they could handle, rallying from a 27-3 third-quarter deficit to force overtime.\n\nNo. 23 Illinois (5-1) scored on the first play of OT, with quarterback Luke Altmyer hitting Pat Bryant for a 25-yard scoring strike. David Olano's point after gave Illinois a 50-43 lead.\n\nThe Boilermakers answered, scoring two plays into their OT possession. Instead of kicking to tie, Purdue attempted a two-point conversion. Quarterback Ryan Browne dropped back, scrambled and could not escape — as Dylan Rosiek sacked him and the Illini celebrated the rivalry win.\n\nAltmyer led the Illini, going 20-for-34 with 379 yards and three touchdowns. He added 60 rushing yards and a score for Illinois, which played without leading rusher Kaden Feagin, listed as \"out\" on the pregame availability report.\n\nJosh McCray filled in as the top rushing option, finishing with 78 yards and two touchdowns on 16 carries.\n\nIllinois spread the ball around, with eight receivers catching passes. Bryant led the way with four catches for 104 yards and a TD. Zakhari Franklin added 60 yards and a TD on four catches, while McCray, Hank Beatty, Collin Dixon and Tanner Arkin all had multiple catches.\n\nBrowne finished 18-for-26 with 297 yards and three touchdowns — 288 of those yards after halftime, during which he pulled Purdue from a 24-point deficit to force overtime. He also ran for 118 yards on 17 carries.\n\nPurdue's two big playmakers were running back Devin Mockobee (133 total yards, 2 TDs) and tight end Max Klare (six catches, 133 yards).\n\nWatch Illinois football vs Purdue live on Fubo (free trial)\n\nWhat Illinois coach Bret Bielema said after win over Purdue\n\n• Illini coach Bret Bielema, on his team building a big lead, falling to a Purdue comeback, then coming back to win in OT: “It sounds incredible to say, but I think that was the best thing that could have ever happened to us. To be up like that and have it start to go the other way, then show the resiliency to make plays at the end.\"\n\n• Purdue coach Ryan Walters, on his decision to attempt a 2-point conversion in OT in a bid to win the game: \"(We) made a decision to go for it, and I wouldn't change that decision.\"\n\n• Bielema, on Purdue's 2-point conversion attempt in OT: \"I called it when they won the coin toss. I told Tanner Arkin I wanted to keep our defense on the sideline and go through some calls. I told the defense 'our offense is going to score and go for one, but when Purdue gets it if they score they're going to go for two.' We called their two-point play before our offense even stepped on the field. There was a calmness in our defensive staff with shooting Rosiek up the middle and if there's one guy who I know who's going to make that tackle it's him and he has plenty of them.\"\n\n• Bielema, on Josh McCray: \"He sees all these other running backs come in Kaden Feagin, Aidan Laughrey, and Ca'Lil Velentine; everyone's writing about all those other guys and not him and he continues to persevere. It's a one-handed catch against Nebraska, a flat route today in the first half, a tough 1-yard run near the end zone to score. He continues to battle through as a young man who lost his mom early in life and was raised by his grandma. Unfortunately, he lost her before I ever met him. He gets beat down but keeps getting back up so I couldn't be prouder of him today.\"\n\n• Illini QB Luke Altmyer, on watching Purdue go for 2 points in an attempt to win it in OT: \"I have trust in my defense and we constantly practice these situations. It was so cool to see them do it in that fashion. I knew we had to create pressure and Dylan made an incredible sack.\"\n\n• Illini defender Dylan Rosiek, whose sack on Purdue's 2-point attempt in OT sealed a victory for Illinois: \"The first half they ran a lot of what we expected. In the second half they went into plays that challenged our eyes. They're good scheme plays. We have to have our eyes in better places, we have to be able to adjust and be ready.\"\n\nIllinois vs Purdue final score\nTEAMS\t1\t2\t3\t4\tOT\tF\nPURDUE\t0\t3\t17\t23\t6\t49\nILLINOIS\t10\t14\t3\t16\t7\t50\nFINAL: Illinois 50, Purdue 49 (OT)\n\nThe Boilermakers need just two plays to score and pull within 50-49. Purdue tried to win the game, but its two-point conversion failed. Ryan Browne dropped back, scrambled and was sacked to end the threat.\n\nIllini strike fast in overtime\n\nLuke Altmyer hits Pat Bryant for a 25-yard touchdown pass on the first play in overtime. What a throw. David Olano puts the Fighting Illini ahead 50-43.\n\nIllinois-Purdue headed into overtime\n\nFighting Illini kicker David Olano hits a 38-yard field goal to tie the game at 43-43 and send the game into overtime.

Purdue has all three timeouts remaining.\n\nIllinois holding on to lead late vs Purdue\n\nPurdue has the ball with two minutes remaining, threatening to pull within a score. Boilermakers QB Ryan Browne has engineered a solid drive and has Purdue threatening. Brown has thrown for 238 of his 247 yards in the second half.\n\nScore update: Illinois 40, Purdue 28\n\nThe Fighting Illini answer back as Josh McCray scores his third touchdown of the day with 5:05 remaining. The TD was set up by another key run from Luke Altmyer and a big third-down catch from McCray earlier in the drive.\n\nAfter a penalty, the Illini tried an 18-yard two-point conversion try — but the pass fell short.\n\nScore update: Purdue answers back to get within a TD\n\nRyan Browne finds Jaron Tibbs for an 8-yard touchdown to pull the Boilermakers within 34-26 — and then adds the two-point conversion to pull within 34-28 at the 10:35 mark of the fourth quarter.\n\nScore update: Illinois 34, Purdue 20\n\nQuarterback Luke Altmyer took it into his own hands this drive, rushing for a 13-yard touchdown to put the Fighting Illini back ahead by two touchdowns early in the fourth quarter. Altmyer also had runs of 22 and 37 yards on the drive to set up the TD.\n\nPurdue trick play sets up field goal\n\nThe Boilermakers used a flea flicker to set up a 62-yard passing connection from Ryan Browne to tight end Max Klare, who was wide open after the double handoff flea flicker.\n\nPurdue is shut down inside the 10, but pulls within 27-20 after the 24-yard field goal from Spencer Porath.\n\nPurdue returns fumble for touchdown\n\nThe Boilermakers are back in this game. Nyland Green sacked Illinois QB Luke Altmyer, forcing a fumble picked up by Will Heldt and returned 16 yards for a score. Illinois still leads 27-17, but is on the ropes for the first time today.\n\nScore update: Illinois 27, Purdue 10\n\nPurdue scores its first touchdown in two weeks, getting a 53-yard reception by Jahmal Edrine, who dove to stretch for the TD in the final yards. The call was upheld after an officials' review. This is the Boilermakers' first TD since Sept. 28 vs. Nebraska.\n\nScore update: Illinois 27, Purdue 3\n\nDavid Olano extends the Fighting Illini lead to 27-3 with a 49-yard field goal into the wind, clearing the uprights easily. Olano pumped his fist after the make.\n\nHALFTIME: Illinois 24, Purdue 3\n\nA look at the Illini stat leaders as they take a commanding lead into halftime:\n\nPASSING: Luke Altmyer 13-for-18, career-high 215 yards, 2 TDs\nRUSHING: Josh McCray, 6 carries, 35 yards, TD; 2 catches, 18 yards, TD\nRECEIVING: Zakhari Franklin, 3 catches, 51 yards, TD\nBONUS STAT: Purdue has 9 passing yards in the first half — its lowest in a half since 2000.\nScore update: Illinois 24, Purdue 3\n\nIllinois has scored twice in the last 90 seconds of game time, this one a short pass from Luke Altmyer to Josh McCray with 19 seconds left in the second quarter.

The score was set up by a 34-run from Devin Mockobee, which took the Boilers down inside the 5.\n\nIllinois QB Luke Altmyer career-best quarter\n\nIllini QB Luke Altmyer threw for 111 yards in the first quarter, staking Illinois to a 10-0 lead over Purdue. That is a career high for Altmyer.\n\nIllinois defense continues to shine\n\nPurdue is now 1-for-4 on third-down conversions, and Illinois forces another punt — this one returned 24 yards by former Rochester High star Hank Beatty. If Illinois can score on this possession, it will seize control of this game.\n\nScore update: Illinois 10, Purdue 0\n\nQB Luke Alymyer hits Pat Bryant for a 29-yard pass, then another 18-yarder, and Illinois caps the drive with an 11-yard touchdown run for Josh McCray.

      "content": "A sold out crowd of college football fans pack Memorial Stadium during an NCAA college football game between Illinois and Kansas on Saturday, Sept. 7, 2024, in Champaign, Ill. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)AP\n\nBy Cayden Steele | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\n\nThe Purdue Boilermakers face the No. 23 Illinois Fighting Illini on Saturday, Oct. 12, 2024 (10/12/2024) at University of Illinois Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Illinois.\n\nHow to watch: Fans can watch the game for free via a trial of fuboTV or DirecTV Stream.\n\n0:06\n/\n0:23\nKeep Watching\nLions vs Cowboys SGP\n\nHere’s what you need to know:\n\nWhat: NCAA Football, Week 7\n\nWho: Purdue vs. Illinois\n\nWhen: Saturday, Oct. 12, 2024 (10/12/2024)\n\nWhere: University of Illinois Memorial Stadium\n\nTime: 3:30 p.m. ET\n\nTV: FS1\n\nChannel finder: Verizon Fios, AT&T U-verse, Comcast Xfinity, Spectrum/Charter, Optimum/Altice,Cox,DIRECTV, Dish, Hulu, fuboTV, Sling.\n\nLive stream: fuboTV or DirecTV Stream\n\nAP preview:\n\nPurdue (1-4, 0-2 Big Ten) at No. 23 Illinois (4-1, 1-1), Saturday, 3:30 p.m. ET (FS1)\n\nBetMGM College Football Odds: Illinois by 19 1/2.\n\nSeries record: Purdue leads 48-45-6.\n\nWHAT’S AT STAKE?\n\nWith important Big Ten games coming up against No. 24 Michigan and No. 3 Oregon and five ranked opponents on its schedule over a seven-game stretch, No. 23 Illinois can’t afford a letdown against a struggling Purdue team that has lost four in a row and was crushed 52-6 last Saturday by Wisconsin.\n\nKEY MATCHUP\n\nIllinois’ passing attack vs. Purdue’s secondary. Luke Altmyer is 14th nationally in completion percentage (70%), 19th nationally in passing efficiency (164.0) and has thrown 11 TD passes. Pat Bryant is fifth in the nation and second in the Big Ten in receiving touchdowns with six. One of the few highlights of Purdue’s loss to Wisconsin was DB Kyndrich Breedlove’s back-to-back interceptions. They were the Boilermakers’ first interceptions of the season.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nIllinois: LB Gabe Jacas. The 6-foor-3, 275-pound outside linebacker has emerged as a leader of Illinois’ improved defense. He’s made 25 tackles and forced two fumbles. Jacas has played in all 30 games in his first three seasons at Illinois with 23 starts.\n\nPurdue: DB Dillon Thieneman. After an All-American freshman season last year, the safety ranks 11th nationally and third in the Big Ten in solo tackles (5.4 per game). He’s made 31 tackles in the last three games, including eight last week vs. Wisconsin.\n\nFACTS & FIGURES\n\nThe winner of Saturday’s game will take home the Cannon Trophy. Purdue holds a 40-30-2 advantage in Cannon Trophy games in a series that began in 1943. ... Purdue has beaten a ranked Illinois team three times, the last in 2022. ... Five of Purdue’s seven remaining games this season are against ranked opponents. ... Only 14 Illinois players are in their final season of eligibility. That ties Iowa State for the lowest total in Power-4 conferences. ... Illinois has beaten two Top 25 teams (Kansas and Nebraska) in a season for the first time since 2007. Before those victories, Illinois was 2-32 in its previous 34 games against Top 25 teams. No. 8 Tennessee and Syracuse are the only other teams with two Top 25 wins this season. ... Illinois alum Sean Evans, host of the popular YouTube show Hot Ones, will sound the traditional air raid siren before the game.\n\nMORE SPORTS COVERAGE\nEagles lose a key defensive player early in the 2nd half of game vs. Browns\nMets add veteran infielder to NLCS roster | Who was left off?\nCarolina Panthers vs. Atlanta Falcons FREE LIVE STREAM (10/13/24): Watch NFL Week 6 online | Time, TV, Channel\nLas Vegas Raiders vs. Pittsburgh Steelers FREE LIVE STREAM (10/13/24) | How to watch, time, TV channel for NFL Week 6\nDenver Broncos vs. Los Angeles Chargers FREE LIVE STREAM (10/13/24): Watch NFL Week 7 online | Time, TV, Channel\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.\n\nCayden Steele may be reached at CSteele@njadvancemedia.com\n\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
